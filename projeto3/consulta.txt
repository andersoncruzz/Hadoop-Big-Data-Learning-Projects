The wheel belongs to the goddess Fortuna (mythology)|Fortuna, who spins it at random, changing the positions of those on the wheel - some suffer great misfortune, others gain windfalls.OriginsThe concept developed in ancient history|antiquity; it was used by Cicero. The Wheel originally belonged to the Roman goddess Fortuna, whose name seems to derive from ''Vortumna'', &quot;she who revolves the year&quot;. Fortuna eventually became Christianized: the Ancient Rome|Roman philosopher Boethius (d. 524) was a major source for the medieval view of the Wheel, writing about it in his''Consolation of Philosophy|Consolatio Philosophiae''.Carmina BuranaFile:CarminaBurana wheel.jpg|thumb|250px|The wheel of fortune from the ''Burana Codex''; The figures are labelled &quot;Regno, Regnavi, Sum sine regno, Regnabo&quot;: I reign, I reigned, My reign is finished, I shall reignThe Wheel of Fortune motif appears significantly in the ''Carmina Burana'' (or ''Burana Codex''), over one thousand poems and songs — often profane in content — written by students and clergy in the early 13th century. Excerpts from two of the collection's better known poems, &quot;''Fortuna Imperatrix Mundi'' (Fortune, Empress of the World)&quot; and &quot;''Fortune Plango Vulnera'' (I Bemoan the Wounds of Fortune),&quot; read:: ''Sors immanis '' : ''et inanis, '' : ''rota tu volubilis'', : ''status malus,'' : ''vana salus'' : ''semper dissolubilis,'' : ''obumbrata '' : ''et velata'' : ''michi quoque niteris; '' : ''nunc per ludum'' : ''dorsum nudum'' : ''fero tui sceleris.'' : . . . . . . . . . . : ''Fortune rota volvitur;'' : ''descendo minoratus;'' : ''alter in altum tollitur;'' : ''nimis exaltatus '' : ''rex sedet in vertice'' : ''caveat ruinam! '' : ''nam sub axe legimus '' : ''Hecubam reginam.'': Fate - monstrous : and empty, : you whirling wheel,: you are malevolent, : well-being is vain : and always fades to nothing,: shadowed: and veiled: you plague me too;: now through the game: I bring my bare back: to your villainy.: . . . . . . . . . : The wheel of Fortune turns;: I go down, demeaned;: another is raised up;: far too high up: sits the king at the summit -: let him fear ruin!: for under the axis is written: Queen Hecuba.Later usageFortune and her Wheel have remained an enduring image throughout history.William Shakespeare in ''Hamlet'' wrote of the &quot;slings and arrows of outrageous fortune&quot; and, of fortune personified, to &quot;break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel.&quot; And in ''Henry V (play)|Henry V'', [http://www.online-literature.com/shakespeare/henryV/16/ Act 3 Scene VI], are the lines:Selections from the ''Carmina Burana'', including the two poems quoted above, were set to new music by twentieth-century classical composer Carl Orff, whose bombastic and well-known &quot;Carmina Burana (Orff)|O Fortuna&quot; is based on the poem ''Fortuna Imperatrix Mundi.Fortuna does occasionally turn up in modern literature. She is often associated with gamblers, and dice could also be said to have replaced the Wheel as the primary metaphor for uncertain fortune.References*''Boethius, [http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new?idBoePhil&amp;imagesimages/modeng&amp;data/texts/english/modeng/parsed&amp;tagpublic&amp;part2&amp;divisiondiv ''The Consolation of Philosophy'']'', trans.

It was created in 1998 by Blizzard Entertainment. ''Starcraft'' is 14 years old and is still played by many people, in many countries around the world. It is very popular in countries like South Korea|Korea and the United States.On May 19, 2007 Blizzard Entertainment|Blizzard announced that they are making StarCraft II. Also, they have held some events for South Korean Starcraft pro-gamers to help them create the game. Plot The story is set in the future, where humans (called ''Terrans'') get stuck in a war between two Extraterrestrial being|alien species, the ''Zerg'' and the ''Protoss''. The Zerg look like monsters, and are all controlled by a very powerful Zerg called the ''Overmind''. They fly around the universe and invade planets. The Protoss, who have very advanced technology, look for the planets that the Zerg have taken over. When they find a Zerg planet, they burn it so that the Zerg on that planet cannot spread to others. In the original series human protagonist Jim Raynor and several Protoss allies attack and defeat the Overmind. In ''Starcraft: Brood War'' Jim's ex-partner Sarah Kerrigan uses deceit and trickery to manipulate the Terran and Protoss into helping her take control of the entire Zerg brood, making her the strongest force in the galaxy. Gameplay ''StarCraft'' players can choose to play as Protoss, Zerg, or Terran (StarCraft)|Terran races. Each race has different soldiers and buildings. Players can choose to play one-player or multiplayer games. In both, the player must gather resources, and use them to build a base and make soldiers to attack the enemy. The player wins when they destroy all the enemies buildings. In one-player mode, there is the Campaign mode, and Custom mode. In Campaign mode, the player goes through a series of missions, which tell the story. Custom mode lets a player choose what race they want to be, what area they want to play on, and what race they will fight against (all enemies are controlled by the computer). During a game, the player must use workers to gather minerals and vespene gas. Minerals appear as blue crystals in the ground and vespene gas comes from a geyser that has green smoke coming out of it. To gather vespene gas, the player needs to build a refinery building to be built on the geyser. The player uses minerals and vespene gas they have gathered to construct buildings and create units to fight the enemy. Buildings are structures that are used to create different kinds of units to fight the enemy. In order to create units, players must build special structures or units that provide ''supply''. If the player does not have enough supply, they cannot create more units. Each player has a supply limit of 200 units. When the player has reached 200 units, they can not make more units.There are many different buildings the player can construct. Most of the buildings are used to build units. There are other buildings that are used for research to upgrade units, making them more powerful. Players can also make defensive buildings that are used to defend against attacking enemy units.Each race have different types of units. The Protoss have powerful warriors and machinery that cost lots of minerals and gas to build. The Zerg use many fast and low cost units to defeat their enemies. Terran units mix between Protoss and Zerg units. They have strong, but easy to kill units that are powerful when used in formation. No race in ''StarCraft'' is more powerful than another race. Blizzard has released many small updates to the game that keep all the races balanced. To win, players must gather and use resources wisely, and use smart strategies. To become very skilled at the game, players also need to become good at micromanagement and macromanagement. Macromanagement means collecting resources, building new bases, and making units to fight. Micromanagement means moving units so they can use their abilities to protect each other and fight the enemy. Players with better micromanagement will win fights against enemies who are not as good at micromanagement. This makes ''StarCraft'' different from many newer games, because the newer games often do much of the micromanagement without the player having to do it.

They live in Africa. Taxonomy * Genus ''Pan'': Chimpanzees** Common chimpanzee, ''Pan troglodytes''** Bonobo or Pygmy chimpanzee, ''Pan paniscus'' Habitat The common chimpanzee lives in West and Central Africa. The bonobo lives in the rain forests of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The two species are on opposite sides of the Congo River. Life and description Chimpanzees mainly eat fruit, leaves, flowers, seeds, bark, honey, insects, bird eggs, and meat. They spend a lot of time with other chimpanzees from their group, acting up, playing, and chatting. Sometimes they will groom each other; combing and looking through each other's thick fur; picking out the dirt and insects. Grooming helps chimps feel comfortable and friendly.Like apes, chimpanzees can walk on two feet, but they prefer to move about on all four legs. They have hands that look like human hands, but their thumbs are shorter than those of humans. At night, chimpanzees sleep in nests that they make on tree branches. They bend twigs and tuck in leaves to make a soft platform to rest in a place that is safe from enemies on the ground. The gestation period of chimpanzees lasts between six and eight months. Usually only one offspring is produced; they rarely have twins. Chimpanzees live up to 60 years in the wild.;ref namechimp;cite book |author Pous, Dinorah|title Blue Planet English through Science level 5|first |coauthors |year2003|publisher Alpha Omega Publications|location |isbn 970-10-3769-3|pages |url ;Jane Goodall has studied chimpanzees since 1960. She observed how chimpanzees use tools in several ways. They will pick up rocks to crack nuts for a meal. They also strip down twigs and stick them into a termite mound to collect a tasty snack. Some have been known to make a sponge from leaves in order to hold more drinking water. The chimp wikt:chew|chews leaves to soften them up, dips them in rainwater, and then squeezes the water into its mouth. Chimpanzees are also known to think ahead and solve problems.;Köhler, Wolfgang 1925. ''The mentality of apes'', transl. from the 2nd German edition by Ella Winter.

At present there is no evidence that the bonobo has a similar level of aggressive behaviour. Attacking monkeys Chimpanzees attack ''Colobus'' monkeys by working as a team to corner them in the high branches of the forest. When caught the monkey is torn apart and eaten.;ref namePBS;cite web |publisherPBS |urlhttp://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/episodes/jane-goodalls-wild-chimpanzees/introduction/1908/ |titleJane Goodall's Wild Chimpanzees |year1996 |accessdate2010-07-28; It is thought the main benefit is that meat is a more rich source of nutrition than their usual vegetarian diet.:&quot;Goodall’s Gombe data have also led researchers to take a closer look at the role that hunting plays in chimp feeding habits. One recent Gombe study, for instance, concluded that the 45 members of one troop ate a ton of monkey meat per year. During one hunting binge, chimps killed 71 colobus monkeys in 68 days; one chimp alone killed 42 monkeys over five years. All told, chimps may kill and eat a third of the Gombe’s colobus population each year. Researchers have also found that lower-ranking males often trade the meat for mating privileges; such trades may help prevent inbreeding&quot;.;ref namePBS/; Otherwise one or two males might father most of a troop’s children. Attacking other chimpanzee groups If they can, male chimpanzees try to kill the male members of neighbouring groups. Males work together when they spot a chance to make a lightning raid on an isolated male from the other group. They kill him. In Gombe Stream National Park|Gombe, Tanzania, a group in the 1970s was seen to kill seven of their neighbours one by one, until all were gone. It can take years for this to happen but, when it does, the remaining females and the neighbouring territory are added to the now larger group. Attacks like this are carefully planned, done only when success is likely, and carried out in silence.The advantage for the males that triumph is to breed more children. Their tribe also holds a larger territory, and so has access to more food.;Mitani J.C; Watts D.P. &amp; Amsler S.J. 2010. Lethal intergroup aggression leads to territorial expansion in wild chimpanzees.

ISBN 978-0-141-01991-8; Communication Chimpanzees show their emotions with their faces and sounds. They make hooting sounds to zoosemiotics|express the discovery of food, and the face of a chimpanzee with a scowling face and lips pressed is to express annoyance. This means the chimpanzee may attack. Or, the chimpanzee may bare its teeth to express that it is afraid or that a more dominant chimp is approaching.;ref namechimp/;;sup;p74/5;/sup;Relationship with humansAccording to a genome study done by the Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium, humans share either 96% or 95% of their DNA with chimpanzees. However, this applies only to single nucleotide polymorphisms, that is, changes in ''single'' base pairs only. The full picture is rather different.24% of the chimpanzee genome does not align with the human genome, and so cannot be directly compared. There are 3% further alignment gaps, 1.23% SNP differences, and 2.7% copy number variations totaling at least 30% differences between chimpanzee and ''Homo sapiens'' genomes. On the other hand, 30% of all human proteins are identical in sequence to the corresponding chimpanzee proteins.;ref nameConsortium;cite journal | author  The Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium | year  2005 | title  Initial sequence of the chimpanzee genome and comparison with the human genome | journal  Nature | volume  437 | issue  1 September 2005 | pages  69–87 | doi  10.1038/nature04072 | pmid  16136131|bibcode  2005Natur.437...69. ; Related pages *Jane Goodall: more information on this page*Ape*Gorilla*Orangutan*Monkey References wikispecies|PanCommonscat|Pan (genus)|PanreflistCategory:Hominins 9jfims5f099mnbqmckwap38sfod31hv

West, ''Hesiod: Theogony'', Oxford University Press (1966), pages 40, 47;;Antony Andrewes, ''Greek Society'', Pelican Books (1971), pages 254–5; The Greeks created Icon|images of their deities for many reasons. A temple would house the statue of a god or goddess, or several deities. The statue might be decorated with relief scenes depicting myths. These were also often painted on pottery and minted on coins.Roman mythology includes many of the same figures, but uses different names: calling Zeus by the name of Jupiter and Aphrodite by the name of Venus (mythology)|Venus, for example.ImmortalsOlympiansmain|Twelve OlympiansThe main and most important gods were the Twelve Olympians.

These were the Commonwealth countries.There were many more countries that she also ruled, because they belonged to the British Empire. One by one, many of the countries became independent, and as they gained independence she became Queen of many of them. Altogether, she was sovereign of 32 nations.Some of the countries are now republics and have a president as &quot;Head of State&quot;, while some of them keep the Queen as &quot;Head of State&quot;. Queen Elizabeth II is the only monarch of more than one independent nation. The old British Empire became the Commonwealth of Nations.It includes both monarchies and republics. It is now called &quot;The Commonwealth&quot;. The Queen is the Head of the Commonwealth. She works hard to keep peace and good communication between all the nations that are members. Relationships with her governments and other countries Ever since she became the Queen, Elizabeth has spent about three hours every day &quot;doing the boxes&quot;. The &quot;boxes&quot; are two large red boxes that are brought to her from the Parliament every day. They are full of state papers sent to her from her various departments, embassies, and government offices.;Information supplied by the Royal Household to a parliamentary inquiry into the workings of the monarchy in the early 1970s.; One of the most famous photos taken of Elizabeth as a teenager shows her with her father, the King, learning about &quot;the boxes&quot;.

She also has meetings with the First Minister of Scotland and other Ministers of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, and the Prime Ministers and Ministers of other countries, when she is in their country, or when they visit London.In the late 1990s, there were &quot;referendums&quot; in which the people of Scotland and Wales were asked if they wanted parliaments that were separate from the parliament of the United Kingdom. This was called a &quot;devolution policy&quot;. As a result, the new Scottish Parliament and the National Assembly of Wales, were set up. The Queen opened the first sessions of these two bodies.Recently, some people in Australia want a republic, with an elected or appointed President as Head of State instead of the Queen. In 1999, the people of Australia were asked in a referendum whether they wanted a republic. The decision of the people was to remain a monarchy. The Queen visited Australia the following year and said that she would continue to serve Australians as she had done for 48 years.Elizabeth II is friends with many world leaders. Her first Prime Minister of Australia, Sir Robert Menzies called her &quot;My Dear&quot; and recited a poem that said &quot;I will love her till I die&quot;.

In her Christmas Day television broadcast in 2000, she said: cquote|To many of us, our beliefs are of fundamental importance.

Her father, King George VI, was not meant to be king. Her uncle became king when her grandfather died. But he fell in love with an American woman who was divorced, and that wasn't allowed. So he had to give up being king very shortly after ascending. George VI didn't want to be king, because he was quite nervous and had a stammer. However, Elizabeth's grandfather said that he didn't think her uncle was very good as a king, and wanted George to reign, then Elizabeth. From the moment she realised that one day she would be Queen, she became very interested in her duties and did all she could to help her father. Her promise to serve her people all her life has always been very important to her. Some people think that now that she is old, perhaps she will retire (&quot;abdicate&quot;) and let her son Prince Charles take over. People who know her well, including Prince Charles, have said that this will never happen.;cite web| url  http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4921120.stm| title  Queen 'will do her job for life'| publisher  BBC News| date19 April 2006| accessdate  4 February 2007; Courage File:ElizabethIItroopingcolour.jpg|thumb|250px|The Queen with Prince Charles and Prince Philip at the &quot;Trooping the Colour&quot; in 1986, riding her favourite horse, Burmese.The Queen has often shown courage, ever since she joined the military at 18. During a trip to Ghana in 1961, she was warned that it was dangerous to be near the President Kwame Nkrumah because people wanted to kill him. But she refused to stay away. The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Harold Macmillan, wrote that the Queen got very impatient with people if they tried to treat her like &quot;a film star&quot;.In 1964, when the Queen was invited to Quebec, there were fears for her safety because there was opposition to her visit. There were suggestions that the tour should be cancelled.

He woke her up, and sat on her bed, until the guards came to take him away. Family relations Throughout her long reign, Queen Elizabeth II has been supported in her duties by her husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. Prince Philip promised to help the Queen on the day of her Coronation. The Queen was also helped by her mother Queen Elizabeth, known as &quot;The Queen Mother&quot;, who lived to be 101 years old, and stayed very active in her old-age. The Queen is the patron of many organisations and charities. She has many invitations and official duties. Many of the duties have been shared by other members of the Royal Family, who have also become patrons of many organisations.File:Trooping the Colour, Saturday June 16th 2007.jpg|thumb|left|250px| The Queen and Prince Philip with some of their family on the balcony of Buckingham Palace, 2007.

The Queen was sad about the broken marriages and divorces of three of her children, Prince Charles, Princess Anne and Prince Andrew. Prince Charles's marriage to Lady Diana Spencer was thought to be a fairytale wedding because she was young and beautiful. But it soon became unhappy, and after their divorce, she was killed in a car accident in 1997. On 9 April 2005, Prince Charles married Camilla Parker-Bowles, whom he had loved for many years. In the year 2002, within a few months of each other, the Queen's mother and sister, Princess Margaret, both died.As the Queen is old, people worry about her health, but she is rarely sick. However, she is leaving more duties to the younger members of the Royal Family, particularly to Prince Charles, who will become monarch on her death.File:Balmoral Castle.jpg|thumb|Balmoral Castle in Scotland is one of the Queen's homes. Wealth The Queen's wealth is private. It is difficult to estimate how much she is worth. She owns Sandringham House, Balmoral Castle, and other large properties.

Her tutor Sydney Gibbes said that Anastasia's acting made everyone laugh.;Christopher, Kurth, Radzinsky (1995), p. 177; On 7 May 1918, Anastasia wrote a letter from Tobolsk to her sister Maria in Yekaterinburg. In the letter, she described a moment of joy, even though she was sad, lonely, and worried about her sick brother Alexei: &quot;We played on the swing, that was when I roared with laughter (laughed loudly), the fall was so wonderful! Indeed! I told the sisters about it so many times yesterday that they got quite fed up (tired)&quot;, adding, &quot;One could simply shout with joy.&quot;;Maylunas and Mironenko (1997), p. 619; In his memoirs, Alexander Strekotin, one of the guards at the Ipatiev House, called Anastasia &quot;very friendly and full of fun&quot;.

According to some accounts, Anastasia once became so unhappy about the locked, painted windows that she opened one to get fresh air. A guard is said to have seen her and fired, almost hitting her. She did not try to open the windows again.;Robert Wilton, &quot;Last Days of the Romanovs&quot;, p.407;On 14 July 1918, local priests at Yekaterinburg held a private church service for the family. They later said that Anastasia and her family fell on their knees during the prayers for the dead, which they had not done before.

One of the priests said, &quot;Something has happened to them in there.&quot;;Helen Rappaport, &quot;Last Days of the Romanovs, Tragedy at Ekaterinburg,&quot; p.162-163; But the next day, on 15 July 1918, Anastasia and her sisters seemed happier. They joked and helped move the beds in their shared bedroom so that the cleaning women could clean the floors. Helping the women scrub the floors, they whispered to them when the guards were not watching.

It is thought that the family had been executed.;ref name&quot;King and Wilson (2003), pp. 353-367;King and Wilson (2003), pp. 353-367;The &quot;Yurovsky Note&quot; was found in 1989 and described in Edvard Radzinsky's 1992 book ''The Last Tsar''. The &quot;Yurovsky Note&quot; was a description of the event by Yurovsky after the execution. According to the note, on the night of the murders the family was awakened and told to dress. They were told they were moving to a new place for their safety. They claimed it was because of the possible violence which might happen when the White Army reached Yekaterinburg. When they were dressed, the family and the few servants were led to a small room in the house's basement. They were told to wait there. Alexandra asked for chairs for herself and Alexei, and she sat next to her son. After a short time, the executioners entered the room, led by Yurovsky. Yurovsky quickly told the Tsar and his family that they were going to die. The Tsar cried &quot;What?&quot; and turned to his family, but was immediately killed when several bullets hit his chest. The Tsar, the empress, and two servants were killed in the first round of shooting. Maria, Dr. Botkin and Alexandra's maid Demidova were hurt. Thick smoke and dust filled the room from the shooting, so the gunmen left the room for a few minutes. They soon came back and shot Dr. Botkin. A gunman named Ermakov tried to shoot Tsarevich Alexei, but the jewels in the boy's clothes protected him. Ermakov tried to kill Alexei with a bayonet but failed again. At last, Yurovsky fired two shots into the boy's head. Tatiana and Olga were near the wall. They were holding onto each other and crying for their mother. Tatiana was killed by a shot to her head. Olga died when Ermakov shot her in the jaw.;King and Wilson, p. 303;;Rappaport, p. 190.;Maria, Anastasia, and the maid Demidova were on the floor under the room's one window. Ermakov said that he killed Maria by shooting her head. Ermakov then tried to stab Anastasia, failed, and said he killed her by shooting her head. Maria's skull does not have any bullet wounds, though. It is unclear how she died. Ermakov was drunk during the murders, and it is possible his shot did not go entirely through her head. She might have become unconscious and bled greatly, but remained alive. Then, as the bodies were taken away, two of the grand duchesses moved. One sat up and screamed, throwing her arm over her head. The other, bleeding from the mouth, wikt:moan|moaned and moved. When Olga and Tatiana were shot, they were killed instantly, so Maria was probably the one who screamed. Anastasia might still have been able to move.;ref name&quot;King and Wilson (2003), pp. 353-367&quot;/; Ermakov told his wife that Anastasia was killed by a bayonet, and Yurovsky wrote that as the bodies were carried out, one or more of the girls cried out and were hit on the back of the head with a club (weapon)|club. However, the back of Maria's skull does not show any signs of having been clubbed. The remains of Anastasia's burnt body do not show details of how she died.;ref name&quot;King and Wilson (2003), pp. 353-367&quot;/; False reports of still being alive and Romanov remainsOne of the greatest mysteries of the 20th century was if Anastasia had survived or not. From 1920 to 1922, Anna Anderson, the most famous person who pretended to be Anastasia, grew very famous. She claimed that she had pretended to be dead, then escaped with the help of a kind guard that saved her from the dead bodies after seeing she was still alive.;Kurth (1983), pp. 33–39; Her law|legal struggle to be recognized as Anastasia from 1938 to 1970 was a controversy for her whole life. It was the longest running case ever heard by the German courts. At last, the courts decided that there was not enough proof.Anderson died in 1984 and her body was cremation|cremated. In 1994, a tissue (biological)|tissue sample from Andersen in a hospital was used for DNA tests with the blood of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. Prince Philip was a grandnephew of Empress Alexandra. Dr. Gill, who did the tests, decided that if &quot;you accept that these samples came from Anna Anderson, then Anna Anderson could nowrap|not ... [have been] related to Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas or Tsarina Alexandra.&quot; Anderson's DNA matched with a great-nephew of Franziska Schanzkowska, a missing Polish factory worker.;ref name&quot;Massie 1995, pp. 194–229&quot;/; Some people who supported Anderson agreed that the DNA tests showed she could not have been the Grand Duchess.;Christopher, Kurth, and Radzinsky (1995), p. 218;;&quot;Anastasia: Dead or Alive&quot;.

When she did not recognize the girl, the guard took her away.;ref name&quot;Kurth43;Kurth (1983), p. 43; Others in Perm later said that they saw Anastasia, her mother and sisters in Perm after they were killed, but this was only a rumor.;ref name&quot;Kurth43&quot;/; Surprisingly, the rumors that had started to hide the fact that the family was dead helped the rumors that they were alive. A few days after they had been killed, the German government sent telegrams to Russia asking for &quot;the safety of the princesses of German blood&quot;. Russia had signed a peace treaty with the Germans and did not want to tell them that the women were dead. Instead, they told them they had been moved to a safer place.;Alexeev, V.V., &quot;Last Act of a Tragedy&quot;, documents from German government files found by Sokolov.; This could have been why the 'Perm stories' began.Another time, eight people said that they saw a young woman being captured at a railway station at Siding 37 in September 1918 after trying to escape. These people were Maxim Grigoyev, Tatiana Sitnikova and her son Fyodor Sitnikov, Ivan Kuklin and Matrina Kuklina, Vassily Ryabov, Ustinya Varankina, and Dr. Pavel Utkin.;Occleshaw (1993), p. 46; Some of these people said that the girl was Anastasia when they saw photographs of the grand duchess by White Russian Army investigators. Dr. Pavel Utkin also told the investigators that the girl, whom he had helped in Perm when she was hurt, had said, &quot;I am the daughter of the ruler, Anastasia.&quot; During that time, there were similar stories of young people in Russia saying that they were Romanovs who had escaped. Boris Soloviev, the husband of Rasputin's daughter Maria, cheating|defrauded many important Russian families by asking for money for a Romanov to escape to China. Soloviev was helped by young women who pretended to be one of the grand duchesses to help trick the families.;Occleshaw (1993), p. 47;Some suggest that there might have been a way for a guard to save anyone in the family who still lived. Yakov Yurovsky ordered the guards to come to his office and give him the things they had stolen after the murder. At that time, it is said that there was a short time when the killed bodies were left in the truck and in the basement of the house. Some guards who had not joined in the murders and had felt sorry for the grand duchesses were left in the basement with the bodies.;King and Wilson (2003), p. 314;There were also stories from Bulgaria that Anastasia and her brother were still alive. In 1953, Peter Zamiatkin told a 16-year-old person being treated at a hospital that he had taken Anastasia and Alexei to the village where he was born near Odessa. He said he was a member of the guard of the Romanovs, and that the Tsar had asked him to do this. Zamiatkin said that after the rest of the family had been killed, he escaped with the children on a ship. &quot;Anastasia&quot; and &quot;Alexei&quot; lived under false names in the Bulgarian town of Gabarevo.

It had actually been found almost ten years earlier, but had been kept hidden by the people who discovered it. They did not want the Communists, who still ruled Russia at that time, to know where the grave was. The grave only had nine bodies instead of 11. DNA and studies on their skeletons showed that they were the bodies of Tsar Nicholas II, his wife, and three of the Grand Duchesses (Olga, Tatiana, and Maria). The other remains had different DNA.

The Russians used a computer program to compare photos of Anastasia with the skulls from the grave. When some of the pieces of bone in the skulls were missing, they guessed how long or wide it was instead.

At that time, a body that measured about 5 feet, 7&amp;nbsp;inches (170&amp;nbsp;cm) was buried as the body of Anastasia. Photographs of her standing next to her sisters six months before she died show that Anastasia was a few inches shorter than all of them.The &quot;Yurovsky Note&quot; showed that two of the bodies were taken from the main grave and burned secretly to hide the burials of the Imperial family. However, people could not find the place where the bodies were burnt for many years.;King and Wilson (2003), p. 469; However, on 23 August 2007, a Russian archaeologist declared that he had found two burned skeletons near Yekaterinburg, at a place which seemed to match what was described in Yurovsky's writings. The archaeologists said that the bones were from a boy who was about 10 to 13, and a young woman who was between 18 and 23 years old. Anastasia was 17 years and one month old when she was killed; Maria was 19 years, one month old, and Alexei was just two weeks before his fourteenth birthday.

The earliest, made in 1928, was called ''Clothes Make the Woman''. The story was about a woman who acts the character of Anastasia in a Hollywood movie, and is later recognized by the Russian soldier who saved her.In 1956, a movie called Anastasia (1956 movie)|''Anastasia'' was made. Ingrid Bergman acted Anna Anderson, Yul Brynner was General Bounine (a fictional character based on several real men), and Helen Hayes as the Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Dowager Empress Marie, Anastasia's grandmother. The movie is about a woman from an asylum who came to Paris in 1928 and was captured by some Russian émigrés who use her so that they can fool Anastasia's grandmother into thinking Anderson actually is her granddaughter. This is because they want to get a Tsarist fortune. After some time, they begin wondering if &quot;Madame A.

The manager wants to buy Scrooge's ranch and become a rich man. Fortunately, Webby and the animals show who is the Manager and Scrooge preserves his ranch. Scrooge asked Webby when, how she made up to captured the bandit, she said &quot;group work&quot;.Master of the DjinniScrooge McDuck and Huey, Dewey and Louie go to the Sahara desert to find Aladdin's lamp. Flintheart Glomgold follows them. The ducks find the lamp's vault but Scrooge and Glomgold rub it at the same time. The djinni comes out and because he can't tell who rubbed the lamp first, he decides to have a race between Scrooge and Glomgold. By Scrooge's suggestion, the djinni decides live in Manor McDuck during the race. Once the djinni and the nephews go to the mansion, Scrooge fights Glomgold's tramps (like the villain trying to kill him with a rock avalanche). Scrooge decides to win the race to Glomgold leave his nephews without a dime.At McDuck's mansion, the djinni starts to like the luxuries of Scrooge's house (because he can eat burgers, swim in the pool and watch TV). He likes it so much that he decides to send Scrooge and Glomgold to back in time so he can live free forever. Because the two billionaires do not know about the time voyage, they continue running when they find a palace. The Sultan, thinking that they are spies of Hemir, decides to give them to crocodiles. But Schewebazade, the Sultan's young wife, saves them and they escape from the palace. The guards follow them and Glomgold go for his count. Meanwhile, the nephews and Webby, who witnessed the evil act of the djinni, put the djinni back in the lamp and let him leave only when he agrees to bring Scrooge back from the past.At this moment, Scrooge and Glomgold come back to the present-day. Unfortunately, Glomgold finds and explores and make over win the race. Obviously, Scrooge can make over come to Duckburg only to discover that Glomgold won the race. Glomgold's first wish is to send Scrooge to a desert island. Glomgold uses his second wish by mistake to go to the desert island with Scrooge (he said he wishes he could see the look on Scrooge's face face when he gets there). At the island, Glomgold wishes that the lamp was never found in the first place. This puts everything back in time to when the ducks open the vault entrance. The explosion made the lamp fall and despite the ducks can back to Duckburg alive, the lamp stays in the vault as never found.Sweet Duck of YouthOne night, Scrooge McDuck and Launchpad go back to Manor McDuck. When Scrooge enters the mansion, he discovers that it is his birthday (which is weird because the show depicts it as a summer night whereas Scrooge's real birthday is in the winter or very late fall) and his family prepared a surprise party. Scrooge is unhappy because he is old. When Mrs. Beakley mentions the fountain of youth, Scrooge runs to the library. There he finds a book that talks about &quot;Ponce de Loon&quot;, a Spanish explorer who said he found the fountain of youth in Florida.The next day, in Florida, the ducks are in a tropical forest when they meet an old man who is also trying to find the fountain of youth.

He led the Irish Parliamentary Party. He played an important part in the fight for Home Rule for Ireland. Background Charles Stewart Parnell was born in Avondale, County Wicklow. His family was upper class. He was the seventh child of John Henry Parnell and his United States of America|American wife Delia Tudor Stewart. Parnell's great-grandmother was in the Tudor dynasty|Tudor family so he was related to the British Royal Family.;ref name&quot;Oxford;Bew, Paul: &quot;Parnell, Charles Stewart (1846-1891), politician and landowner&quot;. ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press .;His parents separated when he was six. He was sent to different schools in England, where he was unhappy. His father died in 1859 and he inherited his fortune. He then studied at Cambridge University (1865-9) but never graduated. He was Sheriff of his county, Wicklow, prior to being an MP (member of the House of Commons). Member of Parliament Charles Stewart Parnell was first elected to the British House of Commons|House of Commons, as a Home Rule League MP for Meath, on 21 April 1875. During his first year Parnell mostly stayed quiet and watched. He first drew attention in 1876 when he said a group of Irish rebels called Fenians (accused of killing a police officer) did not kill anyone. Home Rule Parnell fought for Ireland's right to be self-governing Home Rule Movement. At first he met with Fenians, but he later decided to work with Michael Davitt. He was elected president of Davitt's movement, (called the &quot;Land League&quot;) on 21 October 1879. After becoming the MP for Cork City, he formed a new group with ideas from many other groups called the Irish National League which later became the Irish Parliamentary Party. Although Ireland did not become independent for many years, Parnell's work in Parliament pushed Ireland much closer to their goal by unifying Irish politics. Personal life  Katherine O'Shea On 24 December 1889 Captain William O’Shea decided to divorce his wife Katherine O'Shea. O'Shea had already separated from his wife, but would not divorce her as she was expecting a substantial inheritance.O'Shea at last filed for divorce.;&quot;Filed for divorce&quot; means his lawyer presented an appeal for divorce with the court. It required &quot;grounds&quot;, that is legal reason(s) for the divorce.; He claimed she had an affair and three children with Parnell. Parnell did not reply to the claim, and the divorce was granted. Because divorce is not allowed by Roman Catholicism|Catholics, many Catholics who supported Parnell did not like him anymore and he became less popular.Parnell married Katherine after her divorce. The damage from his affair caused many people to lose respect for him, and he became less powerful. Many members of his party left him. He died on 6 October 1891 of a heart attack and in the arms of his wife. He was 45 years old.

Frances Burney started work on it in 1780. Her father, Dr. Charles Burney and her mentor, Samuel Crisp stopped her from writing a play for the stage, to be titled ''The Witlings''. Frances Burney tried to change their minds, but Dr. Burney insisted she stop and continue writing the more ladylike novels instead. “In the Novel way, there is no danger,” he said.;Letter from Dr Charles Burney to Frances Burney, undated, p. 15; The stress of this made Burney sorrow|unhappy. Critics believe this may be why ''Cecilia'' is sadder than her first novel.PlotCecilia Beverley is a young wikt:heroine|heroine, who leaves her country home to travel to London. She will live with a guardian, Mr. Harrel. Cecelia is an wikt:orphan|orphan wikt:heiress|heiress.

He is afraid Cecilia might fall in love with someone else. At his house she meets Mr. Morrice, a young lawyer; Captain Aresby and Mr. Belfield, who can’t seem to settle down. Mr. Monckton’s wife, Lady Margaret and her servant, Miss Bennet, are also there. Cecilia notices Albany, an old man sitting quietly in the corner, who behaves strangely. She also notices that Lady Margaret dislikes her.Mr. Harrel is married to Cecelia's childhood friend, Priscilla. So, Priscilla gives parties to introduce Cecelia to new friends: Sir Robert Floyer, Mrs. Harrel’s shy brother Mr. Arnott, Mr. Gosport, silly Miss Larolles; and proud, silent Miss Leeson. Mr. Monckton visits her and she greets him happily. At an opera, Cecelia sees Albany, the strange old man again. He shouts a warning that she is in danger from the people around her and that she should help the poor. The next morning, she sees a poor woman, Mrs. Hill, who comes to beg for her starving family. Mr. Harrel has refused to pay them. Cecilia tries to make him pay, but he will not. Finally, Mr. Arnott, feeling sorry for the Hills, lends him the money to pay them.

While Mr. Harrel spends and gambling|gambles his money; Mr. Briggs is a selfish miser and Mr. Delvile is a wikt:vain|vain man.Mrs. Harrel has a masquerade ball. Mr. Monckton is in disguise as a black demon and fights anyone who comes near Cecelia.. A person dressed like a white dominoes|domino tries to help her, as do Mr. Arnott, Mr. Gosport, and Mr. Belfield. Cecilia is surprised at how well the domino knows the faults of her guardians. She wonders who he could be. Later, Cecelia goes to the opera again with Mrs. Harrel. There, she meets Mr. Belfield, who is courteous; but Sir Floyer acts rudely. The two men get angry and have an argument that leads to a duel. Afraid, Cecilia hurries to her house, and worries over the duel.The next morning, Cecelia is told that Mr. Belfield is a little injured, but Sir Floyer is well. Cecilia finds out that the white domino she saw at the masquerade party is Mortimer, Mr. Delvile’s son. Soon after, she meets Mrs. Delvile, who she likes. Now she wants to stay with them, instead of with the Harrels. But, she discovers that Mortimer thinks that she is in love with Mr. Belfield. Or perhaps, that she is engaged to Sir Floyer, who has asked her to marry him. Even though she has refused him, Mr. Harrel tells everyone they will be married soon. Later, she meets Mr. Albany again, who introduces her to Belfield's sister, Henrietta, and asks Cecilia to help her. Cecilia finds out that Mr. Belfield’s wound is serious, but because he does not have enough money he could not call a doctor. She helps the Belfields, begins a friendship with Henrietta, and finds out that Mortimer Delvile, too, is helping them. Disgusted with Sir Floyer’s rudeness and the Harrels’ silliness, she stays for a while with Mrs. Delvile, whom she has become fond of, and Mortimer. But, Mr. Monckton tells lies about them because he sees Cecelia likes them. But Cecilia does not believe him, and she realizes that she is in love with Mortimer, who still thinks she is engaged to Sir Floyer.Mr. Harrel threatens her with his own suicide, so Cecilia lends him money for his debts. Mr. Delvile is suddenly called away, and Mortimer is happy and surprised to find out that Cecelia loves him. But, when she meets him again she is hurt by his coldness to her. Mr. Harrel loses more money by gambling and his violent behavior to his wife frightens Cecilia. After drinking, he suddenly kisses his wife and shoots himself. Terrified and upset, Cecilia meets Mortimer, who forgets to be cold. He travels with her and Mrs. Harrel to Delvile Castle, where Cecilia finds Mortimer’s behavior confusing, and Mrs. Delvile makes it clear that she does not want Cecilia to marry her son. Lady Honoria, a relative of Mrs. Delvile’s, comes and teases her about Mortimer. At last, Mortimer says that he cannot marry her, because he would have to change his name from Delvile to Beverley. He is too sad to see her anymore and he leaves the country. Cecilia says goodbye to him coolly. Mrs. Delvile, instead of going to see her son, goes to her family friend, Mrs. Charlton, and stays with her instead. While there, Mr. Biddulph, a friend of Mortimer's, sees with surprise that she is embarrassed whenever he talks about his friend, and tells that to Mortimer in a letter. Confused, Mortimer decides to find out for himself. Lady Honoria steals Mortimer’s dog, Fidel, and gives it to Cecilia to tease her. One day, Cecilia, patting the dog, talks to him about her love for Mortimer, and how much she misses him – and looking up, sees—Mortimer!Amazed that she loves him, he asks her to marry him. Cecelia is confused, and cannot hide how much she loves him; but she is angry when he suggests that they marry in secret. He explains that his parents will never allow their marriage. So, even though Cecilia is afraid and feels guilty, she says yes. She innocently tells Mr. Monckton about her plans. He becomes furious and tries his best to break them up. During the wedding, he sends Miss Bennet, Lady Margaret’s servant, and his helper, to interrupt it. Mrs. Delvile, hearing of it, comes and tells Cecilia that what Mortimer says is true – she will never let them marry. Cecilia is unhappy, but she loves Mrs. Delvile too much to make her hate her, and finally agrees that she will not marry Mortimer. but he insists on seeing her again. Because of this, all three came together for a last meeting. Mortimer begs Cecilia to be his wife, and says he doesn’t care if he is Mr. Beverley or not. Mrs. Delvile, horrified, suddenly falls very sick. Both Mortimer and Cecilia are frightened, so they decide to do as she says, and never meet again. Mrs. Delvile, after kissing Cecilia goodbye, leaves as soon as she is better. The next day Mrs. Charlton suddenly dies. These events cause Cecelia to be sad and lonely, so she leaves for London. Because she is now old enough to have her fortune, she buys a quiet house in her neighborhood and lives there with Henrietta Belfield. Mortimer suddenly visits them. Cecelia finds out that Mrs. Delvile has said that if she will give up her fortune, so Mortimer will not be Mr. Beverley, but Mr. Delvile, she can marry her son. Mortimer happily says that they can marry with just her personal fortune. Cecilia, horrified, tells him that she has none of her personal fortune left. She has lent most of it to Mr. Harrel, and used the rest for other things, such as helping the Hills. Cecilia also finds out that somebody has told this to Mr. Delvile already, but with lots of lies. She begins to suspect Mr. Monckton. Mrs. Delvile says yes and Cecilia and Mortimer marry quietly and happily.Later, Mrs. Matt, one of the poor people she has helped, tells her who stopped her first wedding—Miss Bennet! Cecilia decides that the person who sent her must have been Mr. Monckton. She also realizes that he, too, must have been the one who lied so bitterly about her to Mr. Delvile. Shortly after, a servant comes and tells her that Mr. Monckton is dead. Soon after, Mortimer comes and says he too had found out Mr. Monckton’s meanness, and he had angrily told Mr. Monckton to tell Mr. Delvile the truth about Cecilia. Mr. Monckton angrily said no, and they shot each other in a furious fight. Mortimer was safe, but Mr. Monckton was badly hurt. Cecilia tells him to leave England with his mother before she can hear about the fight, and agreeing, he goes. However, her marriage has been discovered, so her fortune is taken away from her while Mortimer is gone. Now unable to live in the house she bought, she tells Henrietta to live with Mrs. Harrel and Mr. Arnott while she looks for Mortimer. Cecelia goes to Mr. Belfield to ask for help; but while there, Mortimer suddenly walks into the room and sees them together.Angry, surprised, and jealous, he leaves. Cecilia starts to become crazy. She tries to go to Mr. Delvile for help, but he proudly refuses to see her. At last, some people, thinking she has escaped from a hospital for crazy people, lock her up in a room and write in a newspaper about her. Albany recognizes her, and calls Mortimer to come quickly. Henrietta, too, reads the newspaper, recognizes her, and hurries to see her. Mortimer sees her and quickly calls his old friend, Dr Lyster, to heal Cecilia. Even though she grows crazier while in a fever, she finally gets well. She and Mortimer forgive each other and explain what really happened. Mr. Delvile, feeling guilty when he hears that Cecilia almost died, finally lets her and Mortimer come to his house and see him again. In the end, they live happily together. Mrs. Delvile’s sister gives Cecilia a lot of money when she dies. Cecilia can begin helping the poor again with Albany, who is happy that she did not die. Mrs. Harrel marries again, and soon begins to have parties and friends again. Mr. Arnott and Henrietta marry.

The wheel belongs to the goddess Fortuna (mythology)|Fortuna, who spins it at random, changing the positions of those on the wheel - some suffer great misfortune, others gain windfalls.OriginsThe concept developed in ancient history|antiquity; it was used by Cicero. The Wheel originally belonged to the Roman goddess Fortuna, whose name seems to derive from ''Vortumna'', &quot;she who revolves the year&quot;. Fortuna eventually became Christianized: the Ancient Rome|Roman philosopher Boethius (d. 524) was a major source for the medieval view of the Wheel, writing about it in his''Consolation of Philosophy|Consolatio Philosophiae''.Carmina BuranaFile:CarminaBurana wheel.jpg|thumb|250px|The wheel of fortune from the ''Burana Codex''; The figures are labelled &quot;Regno, Regnavi, Sum sine regno, Regnabo&quot;: I reign, I reigned, My reign is finished, I shall reignThe Wheel of Fortune motif appears significantly in the ''Carmina Burana'' (or ''Burana Codex''), over one thousand poems and songs — often profane in content — written by students and clergy in the early 13th century. Excerpts from two of the collection's better known poems, &quot;''Fortuna Imperatrix Mundi'' (Fortune, Empress of the World)&quot; and &quot;''Fortune Plango Vulnera'' (I Bemoan the Wounds of Fortune),&quot; read:: ''Sors immanis '' : ''et inanis, '' : ''rota tu volubilis'', : ''status malus,'' : ''vana salus'' : ''semper dissolubilis,'' : ''obumbrata '' : ''et velata'' : ''michi quoque niteris; '' : ''nunc per ludum'' : ''dorsum nudum'' : ''fero tui sceleris.'' : . . . . . . . . . . : ''Fortune rota volvitur;'' : ''descendo minoratus;'' : ''alter in altum tollitur;'' : ''nimis exaltatus '' : ''rex sedet in vertice'' : ''caveat ruinam! '' : ''nam sub axe legimus '' : ''Hecubam reginam.'': Fate - monstrous : and empty, : you whirling wheel,: you are malevolent, : well-being is vain : and always fades to nothing,: shadowed: and veiled: you plague me too;: now through the game: I bring my bare back: to your villainy.: . . . . . . . . . : The wheel of Fortune turns;: I go down, demeaned;: another is raised up;: far too high up: sits the king at the summit -: let him fear ruin!: for under the axis is written: Queen Hecuba.Later usageFortune and her Wheel have remained an enduring image throughout history.William Shakespeare in ''Hamlet'' wrote of the &quot;slings and arrows of outrageous fortune&quot; and, of fortune personified, to &quot;break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel.&quot; And in ''Henry V (play)|Henry V'', [http://www.online-literature.com/shakespeare/henryV/16/ Act 3 Scene VI], are the lines:Selections from the ''Carmina Burana'', including the two poems quoted above, were set to new music by twentieth-century classical composer Carl Orff, whose bombastic and well-known &quot;Carmina Burana (Orff)|O Fortuna&quot; is based on the poem ''Fortuna Imperatrix Mundi.Fortuna does occasionally turn up in modern literature. She is often associated with gamblers, and dice could also be said to have replaced the Wheel as the primary metaphor for uncertain fortune.References*''Boethius, [http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new?idBoePhil&amp;imagesimages/modeng&amp;data/texts/english/modeng/parsed&amp;tagpublic&amp;part2&amp;divisiondiv ''The Consolation of Philosophy'']'', trans.

It ends with the Lantern Festival 14 days later. This occurs around the time of the full moon as each complete moon cycle is about 29.53 days long. In the Gregorian calendar used in other country|countries, Chinese New Year falls on different dates each year. It is usually between January 21 and February 20. This means that the holiday usually starts on the second (sometimes the third) new moon after the winter solstice. Animal zodiacs The dates for the Spring Festival from 1996 to 2019 (in the Gregorian calendar) are at the right. The list also includes the year's animal zodiac and it's earthly branch. The names of the earthly branches have no English language|English translations. They are not chinese language|Chinese translations of the animals. The calendar has a 12-year cycle of the animal zodiac and a 10-year cycle of ''heavenly stems''. Each of the ten heavenly stems is associated with one of the five elements of Chinese astrology. These elements are Wood, Fire, dirt|Earth, Metal, and Water. The elements are changed every two years and a yin and yang association changes every year. The elements are named: Yang Wood, Yin Wood, Yang Fire, Yin Fire, and so on. These two cycles create a combined cycle that repeats every 60 years. For example, 1936 was the year of the Yang Fire Rat. 60 years later, 1996 was the next year of the Yang Fire Rat. Differences Some people have problems with the difference between the Chinese birth-year and the Gregorian birth-year. Because the Chinese New Year starts in late January or early February, the Chinese year begins several weeks after it begins in the Gregorian calendar. If a person is born in early January, their Chinese birth-year is the last Gregorian year, not the current one. This causes problems because many people think of the years as the same. For example, 1989 was the year of the Snake. The year 1990 was the year of the Horse. It began on 26 January 1990. This means that anyone born from January 1 to January 25, 1990, was actually born in the year of the Snake not the year of the Horse.File:Hong_Kong_firework_show.jpg|thumb|Hong Kong firework show|203x203px Comparison Chinese New Year is a great festival to Chinese.

What technical data provided from the [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:CheckUser#Basic_interface checkuser interface] may assist a checkuser in separating the users?'''A:''' There are three parts to the checkuser interface; 1) Get IPs (obtains the IP addresses that a named user has used), 2) Get edits from IPs (obtains the edits that a particular IP address has performed), and 3) Get users (provides user names that have edited from a specific IP address). Using a combination of these three tools provides a checkuser with the ability to sort out who is abusing the wiki and who is not. Since many abusive editors have patterns to their editing, it should be possible to only target the right person. If in doubt, it'd be best to check with someone else who is a checkuser or perhaps even a steward. Since browser information is also available, it can be used to aid in separating users as most users probably only use a single OS and browser. This is not definitive however as some users do have multiple machines or use more than one browser. '''Q:'''In what two circumstances are you m:privacy policy|permitted to release an IP (or group of IPs) to an administrator?'''A:'''When the user has performed a lot of vandalism or very disruptive editing it is allowed to release the information to a third-party. This would include admins. Additionally in cases of investigation of abuse and it is also acceptable to release personally identifiable information when the safety of the WMF, its users or the public is at risk. Furthermore it can be released with the permission of the user in question and also when ordered to by a court order or a subpoena. However, it would not normally be needed to actually release the private information of a user. Most often it would be only required to say that the checkuser has been confirmed as the same person, or that the user is from the location they say they are from. '''Q:'''Are you permitted to tell a user that you have checked them?'''A:'''The privacy policy states that when presented with a subpoena to release information to law enforcement or government agencies, that the user whom it is regarding will be contacted in order to inform them information has been requested. This also implies that users can be told they have been checked. Since checkuser requests are normally made on a publicly accessible page on wiki, and since the result (not the actual private info) of a request is then posted to that page, it seems obvious that users will be aware that they have been checked. '''Q:'''How many machines will a CIDR /16 block?'''A:'''CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) is the &quot;solution&quot; that was started to prevent the running out of IP addresses under IPV4 before IPV6 was implmented. It has (in some ways) trumped IPV6 (which very few people actually use). The /16 range block will block 65536 individual IP addresses. It may, however, block many more than that due to use of NAT *network address translation&quot;. But it's the most accurate answer I can give in general terms. '''Q:'''Will technical data always prove if an editor is sockpuppeting?'''A:'''No! There is no such thing as &quot;always&quot;. When ever anyone in life tells you that something will always happen, you can rest assured they it won't. The data will give you a good idea; often a very good idea. But you can rarely be totally sure. Sometimes it will be a judgment call. Sometimes a hard one, occasionally a wrong one (hopfully only rarely). This is why it is important to leave a blocked user able to edit their talk page, or able to email a sysop just in case a mistake was made.;Questions from User_talk:Chris G|;b;;font style&quot;color:Green;;Chris;/font;;/b;'''Q:''' How would you detect if an IP is an open proxy?'''A:'''I've not had much personal experience in dealing with open proxies, but I understand the basics. It is not always going to be possible to 100% determine if it is an open proxy, but one can often get a very good indication that it is by the following. Firstly, one should have a good reason to suspect that an open proxy exists. Such grounds for suspicion can include; that an IP is in fact running a web proxy, and that one of the following additional conditions are met; 1) the proxy permits access to anyone, 2) that it doesn't let anyone access it but that the level of authentication is very weak and easily bypassed, 3) that the details for accessing the proxy are to be found publicly on the Internet, 4) the host has been hijacked so as to allow one or more persons unauthorized access to it. Probable cause for thinking that an open proxy exists are; many edits from a single IP address, especially if they occur around the clock; inconsistent traffic coming from a single IP address or traffic of such a nature as to cause one to think that it is being used by multiple people; similar traffic originating from multiple IP address (esp if from all over the world) that lead one to believe that a single person is using multiple IP addresses can lead one to believe that some of them may be open proxies; listing on sites that contain lists of openproxies or in completewhois reports. There are also multiple checker scripts and tools that can aid one in making the decision. Checking also to see if an IP has been blocked elsewhere on WMF (meta, enWP) as an open proxy can help too. My standard rule would still apply; if in doubt, check with someone who knows more than you, and if need by, err on the side of caution with a short block and then a longer block if it turns out to be an open proxy. '''Q:''' What method do you use to calculate a range block? '''A:'''Generally I'd use a table of CIDR ranges as it is a very quick method and is less prone to error, but I do also have the knowledge to do the binary math if need be. I believe in as small a range block as is needed. I'd also check with the list of sensitive IP addresses and check what collateral blocks of named users I'd be affecting. If there is going to be collateral blocks, I'd consider using an anonymous only block or else giving the named users (if trusted) the flag &quot;IP block exempt&quot;. Again, check with someone else if unsure.Support# &amp;ndash;;strong;User:Juliancolton|;span style&quot;font-family:Script MT;color:#36648B;Juliancolton;/span;;/strong;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;User_talk:Juliancolton|;sup;;span style&quot;font-family:Verdana;color:gray;''Talk'';/span;;/sup; 04:24, 2 August 2009 (UTC)# support '''Super mega extreme support''', completely trust him. --User:S3CR3T|;font color#DE3163;;fontComic Sans MS;'''''S3C''''';/font;;/font;User talk:S3CR3T|;font colorpink;;small;'''''R3T''''';/font;;/small;;small; &amp;hearts;s you!;/small; 04:31, 2 August 2009 (UTC)# I believe Fr33kman is well qualified for this position, and fully trust him.

It is a comical, satirical love story. It was admired by people like Edmund Burke, Mary Wollstonecraft, and Choderlos de Laclos. Background ''Cecilia'' was published in July 1782. Frances Burney started work on it in 1780. Her father, Dr. Charles Burney and her mentor, Samuel Crisp stopped her from writing a play for the stage, to be titled ''The Witlings''. Frances Burney tried to change their minds, but Dr. Burney insisted she stop and continue writing the more ladylike novels instead. “In the Novel way, there is no danger,” he said.;Letter from Dr Charles Burney to Frances Burney, undated, p. 15; The stress of this made Burney sorrow|unhappy. Critics believe this may be why ''Cecilia'' is sadder than her first novel.PlotCecilia Beverley is a young wikt:heroine|heroine, who leaves her country home to travel to London. She will live with a guardian, Mr. Harrel. Cecelia is an wikt:orphan|orphan wikt:heiress|heiress. To inheritance|inherit her money, when she marries, her husband must take her surname and become &quot;Mr. Beverley&quot;. In London, she is wikt:invite|invited to a friend's house (Mr. Monckton), for breakfast, who has married for money. But he loves Cecilia and hopes to marry her when his wife dies. He is afraid Cecilia might fall in love with someone else. At his house she meets Mr. Morrice, a young lawyer; Captain Aresby and Mr. Belfield, who can’t seem to settle down. Mr. Monckton’s wife, Lady Margaret and her servant, Miss Bennet, are also there. Cecilia notices Albany, an old man sitting quietly in the corner, who behaves strangely. She also notices that Lady Margaret dislikes her.Mr. Harrel is married to Cecelia's childhood friend, Priscilla. So, Priscilla gives parties to introduce Cecelia to new friends: Sir Robert Floyer, Mrs. Harrel’s shy brother Mr. Arnott, Mr. Gosport, silly Miss Larolles; and proud, silent Miss Leeson. Mr. Monckton visits her and she greets him happily. At an opera, Cecelia sees Albany, the strange old man again. He shouts a warning that she is in danger from the people around her and that she should help the poor. The next morning, she sees a poor woman, Mrs. Hill, who comes to beg for her starving family. Mr. Harrel has refused to pay them. Cecilia tries to make him pay, but he will not. Finally, Mr. Arnott, feeling sorry for the Hills, lends him the money to pay them. Cecilia, shocked at how mean Mr. Harrel is, wants to go stay with another guardian. But, they seem just as bad. While Mr. Harrel spends and gambling|gambles his money; Mr. Briggs is a selfish miser and Mr. Delvile is a wikt:vain|vain man.Mrs. Harrel has a masquerade ball. Mr. Monckton is in disguise as a black demon and fights anyone who comes near Cecelia.. A person dressed like a white dominoes|domino tries to help her, as do Mr. Arnott, Mr. Gosport, and Mr. Belfield. Cecilia is surprised at how well the domino knows the faults of her guardians. She wonders who he could be. Later, Cecelia goes to the opera again with Mrs. Harrel. There, she meets Mr. Belfield, who is courteous; but Sir Floyer acts rudely. The two men get angry and have an argument that leads to a duel. Afraid, Cecilia hurries to her house, and worries over the duel.The next morning, Cecelia is told that Mr. Belfield is a little injured, but Sir Floyer is well. Cecilia finds out that the white domino she saw at the masquerade party is Mortimer, Mr. Delvile’s son. Soon after, she meets Mrs. Delvile, who she likes. Now she wants to stay with them, instead of with the Harrels. But, she discovers that Mortimer thinks that she is in love with Mr. Belfield. Or perhaps, that she is engaged to Sir Floyer, who has asked her to marry him. Even though she has refused him, Mr. Harrel tells everyone they will be married soon. Later, she meets Mr. Albany again, who introduces her to Belfield's sister, Henrietta, and asks Cecilia to help her. Cecilia finds out that Mr. Belfield’s wound is serious, but because he does not have enough money he could not call a doctor. She helps the Belfields, begins a friendship with Henrietta, and finds out that Mortimer Delvile, too, is helping them. Disgusted with Sir Floyer’s rudeness and the Harrels’ silliness, she stays for a while with Mrs. Delvile, whom she has become fond of, and Mortimer. But, Mr. Monckton tells lies about them because he sees Cecelia likes them. But Cecilia does not believe him, and she realizes that she is in love with Mortimer, who still thinks she is engaged to Sir Floyer.Mr. Harrel threatens her with his own suicide, so Cecilia lends him money for his debts. Mr. Delvile is suddenly called away, and Mortimer is happy and surprised to find out that Cecelia loves him. But, when she meets him again she is hurt by his coldness to her. Mr. Harrel loses more money by gambling and his violent behavior to his wife frightens Cecilia. After drinking, he suddenly kisses his wife and shoots himself. Terrified and upset, Cecilia meets Mortimer, who forgets to be cold. He travels with her and Mrs. Harrel to Delvile Castle, where Cecilia finds Mortimer’s behavior confusing, and Mrs. Delvile makes it clear that she does not want Cecilia to marry her son. Lady Honoria, a relative of Mrs. Delvile’s, comes and teases her about Mortimer. At last, Mortimer says that he cannot marry her, because he would have to change his name from Delvile to Beverley. He is too sad to see her anymore and he leaves the country. Cecilia says goodbye to him coolly. Mrs. Delvile, instead of going to see her son, goes to her family friend, Mrs. Charlton, and stays with her instead. While there, Mr. Biddulph, a friend of Mortimer's, sees with surprise that she is embarrassed whenever he talks about his friend, and tells that to Mortimer in a letter. Confused, Mortimer decides to find out for himself. Lady Honoria steals Mortimer’s dog, Fidel, and gives it to Cecilia to tease her. One day, Cecilia, patting the dog, talks to him about her love for Mortimer, and how much she misses him – and looking up, sees—Mortimer!Amazed that she loves him, he asks her to marry him. Cecelia is confused, and cannot hide how much she loves him; but she is angry when he suggests that they marry in secret. He explains that his parents will never allow their marriage. So, even though Cecilia is afraid and feels guilty, she says yes. She innocently tells Mr. Monckton about her plans. He becomes furious and tries his best to break them up. During the wedding, he sends Miss Bennet, Lady Margaret’s servant, and his helper, to interrupt it. Mrs. Delvile, hearing of it, comes and tells Cecilia that what Mortimer says is true – she will never let them marry. Cecilia is unhappy, but she loves Mrs. Delvile too much to make her hate her, and finally agrees that she will not marry Mortimer. but he insists on seeing her again. Because of this, all three came together for a last meeting. Mortimer begs Cecilia to be his wife, and says he doesn’t care if he is Mr. Beverley or not. Mrs. Delvile, horrified, suddenly falls very sick. Both Mortimer and Cecilia are frightened, so they decide to do as she says, and never meet again. Mrs. Delvile, after kissing Cecilia goodbye, leaves as soon as she is better. The next day Mrs. Charlton suddenly dies. These events cause Cecelia to be sad and lonely, so she leaves for London. Because she is now old enough to have her fortune, she buys a quiet house in her neighborhood and lives there with Henrietta Belfield. Mortimer suddenly visits them. Cecelia finds out that Mrs. Delvile has said that if she will give up her fortune, so Mortimer will not be Mr. Beverley, but Mr. Delvile, she can marry her son. Mortimer happily says that they can marry with just her personal fortune. Cecilia, horrified, tells him that she has none of her personal fortune left. She has lent most of it to Mr. Harrel, and used the rest for other things, such as helping the Hills. Cecilia also finds out that somebody has told this to Mr. Delvile already, but with lots of lies. She begins to suspect Mr. Monckton. Mrs. Delvile says yes and Cecilia and Mortimer marry quietly and happily.Later, Mrs. Matt, one of the poor people she has helped, tells her who stopped her first wedding—Miss Bennet! Cecilia decides that the person who sent her must have been Mr. Monckton. She also realizes that he, too, must have been the one who lied so bitterly about her to Mr. Delvile. Shortly after, a servant comes and tells her that Mr. Monckton is dead. Soon after, Mortimer comes and says he too had found out Mr. Monckton’s meanness, and he had angrily told Mr. Monckton to tell Mr. Delvile the truth about Cecilia. Mr. Monckton angrily said no, and they shot each other in a furious fight. Mortimer was safe, but Mr. Monckton was badly hurt. Cecilia tells him to leave England with his mother before she can hear about the fight, and agreeing, he goes. However, her marriage has been discovered, so her fortune is taken away from her while Mortimer is gone. Now unable to live in the house she bought, she tells Henrietta to live with Mrs. Harrel and Mr. Arnott while she looks for Mortimer. Cecelia goes to Mr. Belfield to ask for help; but while there, Mortimer suddenly walks into the room and sees them together.Angry, surprised, and jealous, he leaves. Cecilia starts to become crazy. She tries to go to Mr. Delvile for help, but he proudly refuses to see her. At last, some people, thinking she has escaped from a hospital for crazy people, lock her up in a room and write in a newspaper about her. Albany recognizes her, and calls Mortimer to come quickly. Henrietta, too, reads the newspaper, recognizes her, and hurries to see her. Mortimer sees her and quickly calls his old friend, Dr Lyster, to heal Cecilia. Even though she grows crazier while in a fever, she finally gets well. She and Mortimer forgive each other and explain what really happened. Mr. Delvile, feeling guilty when he hears that Cecilia almost died, finally lets her and Mortimer come to his house and see him again. In the end, they live happily together. Mrs. Delvile’s sister gives Cecilia a lot of money when she dies. Cecilia can begin helping the poor again with Albany, who is happy that she did not die. Mrs. Harrel marries again, and soon begins to have parties and friends again. Mr. Arnott and Henrietta marry. Mr. Belfield still cannot settle down to a job, but finally, with the help of Mortimer, goes into the army and is happy.Characters*Cecilia Beverley: the wikt: heroine|heroine of the story.

Because of this, he hates Mortimer and later fights with him. Cecilia, not knowing that he likes her, is friendly to him at first because she thinks he is clever and nice.*Lady Margaret: Mr. Monckton’s angry, jealous, old, and ugly wife.*Sir Robert Floyer: a selfish man who wants to marry Cecilia because she is pretty and has a lot of money. Cecilia does not like him at all, but Mr. Harrel tries to make them marry.*Mr. Belfield: a good-hearted man, but cannot find a job he likes. He is proud, and does not want anybody to know he is a tradesman’s son.*Henrietta Belfield: Mr. Belfield’s sister. She is grateful, loving, and honest. She thinks more about her brother and Cecilia than herself. She is fond of Mortimer Delvile and is sad when he marries Cecilia. She later marries gentle Mr. Arnott.*Mr. Arnott: the gentle, shy, and serious brother of Mrs. Harrel. He wants to marry Cecilia, and he is the only person she really feels sorry for when she says no. He is not as wikt:brave|brave as Cecilia, but he still has a good heart (he helps the Hills, and feels sorry for his sister).*Albany: a gruff old man who tries to help poor people. He is surprised at how kind Cecilia is.*Lady Honoria Pemberton: a relative of Mrs. Delvile. She likes to broken wikt link| gossip|gossip and tease Cecilia. Her teasing hurts Cecilia. She also likes to laugh at Mr. Delvile and his castle.*Fidel: Mortimer’s dog. Cecilia loves Fidel and talks to him about how much she loves Mortimer.Other writers and ''Cecilia''Jane Austen, a famous writer, talked about ''Cecilia'' in her novel, ''Northanger Abbey'': “'And what are you reading, Miss — ?' 'Oh! It is only a novel!' replies the young lady, while she lays down her book with affected indifference, or momentary shame. 'It is only ''Cecilia'', or ''Camilla'', or ''Belinda'''; or, in short, only some work in which the greatest powers of the mind are displayed, in which the most thorough (complete) knowledge of human nature, the happiest delineation of its varieties, the liveliest effusions of wit and humour, are conveyed (shown) to the world in the best–chosen language.&quot;The title of Austen's ''Pride and Prejudice'' is probably from Dr Lyster’s speech at the end of ''Cecilia'': “remember: if to pride and prejudice you owe your miseries, so wonderfully is good and evil balanced, that to pride and prejudice you will also owe their termination.”;Writing Pride and Prejudice, available online: [http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/pride-and-prejudice/biography/pride-and-prejudice-biography-finished].

I do this because I think it needs to be done.In my opinion we should delete all these pages from this wiki. They are basically unreadable by our target audience, and likely to damage us. It has become clear that the pages are unsimplified (or almost unsimplified) copies of very technical enWP articles. Most of the chemistry is at graduate level, or advance undergraduate level, which is an issue worth considering.More important is that the user who brought the material over has not, and maybe cannot, simplify the contents adequately. Apparently, he tries, but may not know enough chemistry, and does not have the editing skills at present to simplify them. I would say, informally, one would need to be a pretty experienced chemistry professor to simplify concepts at this level. Because the simplification cannot be done quickly, if at all, the pages should not sit there as they are. It is asking for trouble. Pages like these are a hostage to fortune: we could find extracts used by unfriendly persons against us.It would always be possible for an editor to re-introduce any of these topics in a manner which satisfies our rules.User:Macdonald-ross|Macdonald-ross (User talk:Macdonald-ross|talk) 07:36, 1 August 2011 (UTC)col-begincol-break*Molecular orbital ‎*Stereochemistry *Molecular symmetry *Electrocyclic reaction *Mechanical stress *Continuum mechanics *Pericyclic reaction col-break*Cycloaddition *Cheletropic reaction *Sigmatropic reaction *Group transfer reaction *Torquoselectivity *Dyotropic reaction *Theoretical chemistry col-break*Frontier orbital *Substituent *Diene *Conjugated system *Woodward's rulescol-end:I very reluctantly '''agree''', except for Diels–Alder reaction. Racepacket is not the only editor with an interest in simplifying that one. Peterdownunder has taken an interest as well. Let's leave something to work with. If that becomes simple, then other articles can be recreated. If not, we'll have evidence to show that these were not appropriate. Also, it is worth noting that Continuum mechanics seems to not be one of Racepacket's.:::Diels-Alder reaction, at least the intro is worth keeping as it explains why the two scientists were awarded the Nobel Prize. This is probably a class of article that we need for all the Nobel Prizes. --User:Peterdownunder|Peterdownunder (User talk:Peterdownunder|talk) 11:27, 1 August 2011 (UTC)::::This is a fair point. I have edited the Diels–Alder reaction page down to the minimum necessary to support the Nobel Prize references, and removed it from the list of AfD. It is still fairly bad as the links go to other, even more incomprehensible pages. User:Macdonald-ross|Macdonald-ross (User talk:Macdonald-ross|talk) 12:35, 5 August 2011 (UTC):It is also worth noting that rather than fixing these, Racepacket has gone ahead and created yet another imported article from En, Lyonel Feininger. This one at least is simple. The editor did follow the letter of the ban by working through his user page, but not the intent. His other copied articles still need hours and hours of attention. User:Gotanda|Gotanda (User talk:Gotanda|talk) 10:28, 1 August 2011 (UTC)::I don't think that Ad hominem arguments are helpful. I have a degree in Chemistry. I worked on the Lyonel Feininger article as a part of the edit session at the Archives of American Art on Friday. They assigned the topic. I did not create Continuum mechanics, but deletion debates should be decided on their merits not the identity of the editors. These articles can be useful to high school chemistry students or to chemists that do not have English as their first language. If you look in the subject index of most organic chemistry survey course text books, you will find these topics. As shown on the talk page Talk:Diels–Alder reaction you will see a number of experiments that show that the &quot;readability index&quot; of an article goes up when I add parentheticals and restatements that explain the concepts in simple terms. The experiments also show that the index is biased against the polly syllable words used by chemists. I am willing to respond to deletion debates on the individual articles, but I can't find them. (For example, Frontier orbital is just a redirect page on both this Wikipedia and en:wikipedia.) Thanks, User:Racepacket|Racepacket (User talk:Racepacket|talk) 13:21, 1 August 2011 (UTC):::I don't think deleting these pages (or a subset) would be the answer. About the chemistry, I cannot help; all I can do is read the respective article at another wp, and then try to &quot;paraphrase&quot; the subject in understandable language. Articles like molecular orbital, and molecular symmetry are central, and IMO we should have them (in an understandable form). What I see though is the incremental approach: copy the whole article to the talk page, and then move back one section at time, and simplify. Given our audience, I think it is better to have a shorter article that laves out certain parts, but that is understandable, rather than a longer one, that includes them, but is more difficult to understand. Consequently, this would probably be the way forward. If we as a community cannot tackle these problems (for lack of knowledge), we might also try to convince some chem-savy editors from enwp. As an example, compare :en:Cauchy distribution to Cauchy distribution; Yes I know, we are comparing a 500-byte article to a 27kb one; but the idea should be quite apparent. To me, it is also clear that articles need time to grow. Simplifying an article is a lot of work, esp. if we envisage to stamp it with GA or VGA. :en:Poisson distribution vs. Poisson distribution is similar (30k vs. 2k). In short, simplifying complex subjects takes time, all we can do in the interim is make sure that what is there sums up the most important points, and is understandable by our target audience. Speaking of the Poisson distribution: Siméon Denis Poisson, an 18th century French physicist does not have an article yet...--User:Eptalon|Eptalon (User talk:Eptalon|talk) 14:07, 1 August 2011 (UTC)*'''Userfy:''' Now Racepacket is working under restrictions that force him to simplify articles he's written/copied in his userspace.

Thanks, User:Racepacket|Racepacket (User talk:Racepacket|talk) 22:31, 6 August 2011 (UTC)::I believe that much has changed since User:Macdonald-ross|Macdonald-ross has made his mass nomination. Each article is very different from the others. May I suggest that we discuss and vote on them separately one-by-one? I know that everyone is working toward what is best for Wikipedia. Thanks, User:Racepacket|Racepacket (User talk:Racepacket|talk) 17:58, 7 August 2011 (UTC)::Per Racepacket, I'd also prefer a request for each page, although we are currently working on this stuff to make it simpler. -User:Barras|Barras (User talk:Barras|talk) 18:20, 7 August 2011 (UTC)::::19 different RfDs to manage all of these separately are not needed because they all share a common problem. Although there have been some changes, if these are not deleted, they should at least be userfied and any return to the namespace should be fairly cautious (not just one person ticking a box). For one example, look at Stereochemistry and my comments on the Talk:Stereochemistry|Talk page. Much of the intro is still complex (although Peterdownunder did fix the first two sentences). As the article goes on, it gets more complex. There is still a whole complex chunk taken direct from En. What seems to happen in these articles is that the first sentence of a section or paragraph may be changed, but the rest of it left as-is. Yes, Barras is trying to help Racepacket with simplification, and I think my comments have pointed out where articles need to be simpler, but all of these articles (except for Diels–Alder reaction) need a lot of work to really be simple. Aside form just word simplification and sentence by sentence simplification, many of them need a simpler structure and a simple explanation of the context in the introduction. I think most of Macdonald-ross' original concerns remain. User:Gotanda|Gotanda (User talk:Gotanda|talk) 22:52, 8 August 2011 (UTC):::::There is a wide spectrum of articles in this list. One is just a simple redirect: Frontier orbital. Another is just two sentences: Group transfer reaction. It is impossible to write a simpler article about Group transfer reactions than this one. In Molecular symmetry, we include a table of 30 point groups with example molecules for each group. The table presents an important aspect of the topic. By using a table (which does cover complex ideas), we avoid any problems regarding complexity of English.:::::I have compared theoretical chemistry against the articles covering the other branches of chemistry, and they are all at about the same level of complexity. None should be deleted.;P;The basic difference that was brought out in the dialog between Barras and Macdonald-ross is the intended audience for these articles. I doubt that any third grader will want to read about molecular orbitals, but high school students or chemists which do not have English as their first language will value these articles. If you compare each article line-by-line, you will see that it is different from the English Wikipedia version. Although the ideas are complex, the wording is simple. The articles should be kept. Thanks, User:Racepacket|Racepacket (User talk:Racepacket|talk) 03:02, 9 August 2011 (UTC)As a user interested in physics and chemistry (but not at an very advanced level) I understood the majority these articles fairly easily, even though they deal with complicated subjects. Just because the subject matter is complicated and your average person may not find it enjoyable/useful to persevere with them does not mean they should be deleted. Racepacket has done a very good job of using simple syntax (and vocabulary where technical terms are not needed) to explain complex subjects. Definite keep.

As she is campaigning, Angus tells her that to run for A.N.T. Rep, you have to participate in every school activity(including what the cheerleaders shoot out of their cannon, being the &quot;Jumbo bunny&quot; prize for whoever wins the knock the can other game at the school fair and being the mirror ball at prom), so Chyna tricks Olive into running too. They both tell everyone to vote for the other person. In the middle of the election, Olive is winning by a short gap. Cameron makes a speech while Chyna and Olive argue and everyone agrees with him. Lexi runs for school president and gets the title. Some how, Cameron is nominated for A.N.T. Rep and gets the title. He wonders and Lexi says that students under five feet automatically run for A.N.T. Rep when they're nominated. Chyna and Olive are relieved and they make friends.

Hello, I was wondering in what way people become notable by travelling on a ship, the Mayflower. Articles about passengers are being created, yet for people such as Humility Cooper, almost nothing is known (except that she seemed to have travelled on the Mayflower as a child, and later in life, returned to the Old World). Yes, there are records mentioning her name. I do however think that &quot;notability&quot; in our sense is probably different. Given the few things that are known about her, the interest in her is probably limited to academic sources (for example those that look at the conditions of women at that time). In other words: in my opinion, having a separate article about her is probably wrong. A similar case can probably be made about other passengers of the Mayflower. In short, I think that we should not have separate articles for most passengers. So far I have not nominated any articles for deletion as I think that this is more a discussion about what action make a person notable. Note that the Mayflower did not have any accident, the ship simply transported people to the New World (Plymouth Colony, iirc), and back. :en:Thomas Andrews (shipbuilder)|Thomas Andrews (enwp) was a shipbuilder that died when the RMS Titanic collided with the iceberg, he is generally described as a hero, helping others leave the ship. Is he notable? What about :en:Madeleine Astor|Madeleine Astor (enwp), who survived the accident, and died in 1940? Or :en:Millvina Dean|Milvina Dean (enwp), who died in 2009, and who was the youngest person aboard the Titanic? - In short, what makes a person notable? --User:Eptalon|Eptalon (User talk:Eptalon|talk) 13:03, 21 May 2013 (UTC):You ask good questions. To me, Humility Cooper, for example, is probably pretty borderline. :That said, do understand that in US history, ''Mayflower'' has a unique, almost iconic status as ships go. It was the first ship to bring European settlers to the colonies that became the New England states. Those colonists were the first who came over as refugees from religious persecution, which in the US was a historically and culturally important aspect of the entire European colonization process. The story of the Plymouth Colony's survival through their first winter, culminating in the &quot;first Thanksgiving&quot; is an iconic story that substantially all US children learn in school. (Whether they learn it with historical accuracy ... is another matter!) :So at some level US citizens see almost everything pertaining to the history of that voyage of ''Mayflower'' as noteworthy at a certain level. ''The noteworthiness comes from a combination of the ''Mayflower'' voyage itself and the subsequent founding and building of Plymouth Colony,'' but as a perhaps-sloppy shortcut we tend to think of it mainly in terms of ''Mayflower.''::In comparison, when you look at ''Titanic,'' a ''Titanic'' survivor (I think) would need at least something beyond pure presence on the ship to qualify. Astor (above) was certainly noteworthy in her own right, even if ''Titanic'' added to her fame. Andrews (above) was ''Titanic's'' naval architect, not just a passenger and hero. So he was inherently noteworthy, too. (It's at least arguable that even if ''Titanic'' had never existed, he would still have been noteworthy.)::With respect to Dean, it's more borderline. But the fact that she was the youngest passenger, and the last survivor, gives her a certain cachet, too. I'm not sure that she'd have been considered noteworthy if we were doing this 100 years from now, but I'm not sure we're wrong for including her now.:So I come to the conclusion that to be noteworthy, a passenger needs ''something'' besides mere presence on the ship. With ''Mayflower'' the critical difference is that all the passengers have something else: they have Plymouth Colony. :User:StevenJ81|StevenJ81 (User talk:StevenJ81|talk) 14:19, 21 May 2013 (UTC)::Hmmm... In terms of Humility Cooper I'd tend to say that she isn't notable. The ship is, and those on the ship collectively would be notable - for example the fact they collectively created the Mayflower Compact. Individually, I'd say no. Especially when almost nothing is known about her. I'd suggest merging all the passenger articles (of which there are some, but also many redlinks) into Mayflower passengers and possibly a list with the little info known about them? If individuals have notability for some other reason, such as John_Carver_(Mayflower_passenger)|John Carver who was the first Governor of Plymouth Colony they can have their own article... Basically; if they are notable as a group then they should have a group article, notable on their own, own article in this instance... ;small;user:kennedy|;font color&quot;#800000&quot; face&quot;lucida handwriting;Kennedy;/font;;/small; ;sup;(user_talk:kennedy|;font color&quot;#800000;talk;/font;) ;/sup; 14:23, 21 May 2013 (UTC):::I would like to thank Eptalon for notifying me of this discussion and allowing me to state my opinion here. I have to respectfully disagree with the editor who does not think her notable. You cannot &quot;lump&quot; these people together. They came from different places, different countries and for many different reasons.:::Humility Cooper, is, in my opinion, not only notable, but especially notable to Simple Wikipedia whose articles are mainly directed to readers who are young in age. She travelled as a one year old child and was the youngest of the passengers, except for one other who was born on the ship. She was orphaned in Europe and travelled with persons who were probably her aunt and uncle, The Tilley family. Unfortunately, she also was soon to lose them to the cold and sickness of the first winter that took so many who had been passengers on the ''Mayflower'' and was then placed with yet another family. Humility witnessed the first encounter with the Native American population and the Thanksgiving|First Thanksgiving and did not returned to Europe until late in her teens, probably at nineteen years of age.:::It is true that there is little information of Humility at this time, but more records are, even today, being gathered and discovered by professional researchers in Europe and the United States.:::I think the young readers would not only find her notable but also would benefit greatly to know of her story. It is a story of courage that would inspire many young readers. I would also add that I believe that all of the passengers were notable just for being a passenger on the historic and momentous voyage of the ''Mayflower'', its extremely dangerous voyage which few ordinary people especially children had experienced before 1620 and for their part in the discovery and the settlement of Plymouth Colony. Humility grew and prospered even while more than half of the passengers died.:::I would hope that we would treasure this young child's story and that of all ''Mayflower'' passengers and to know that more information is actively being gathered even now on Humility and all of the other ''Mayflower'' passengers. While to adults, Humility's story may seem short of facts, to child readers, I think there is much there, spoken and unspoken.User:MySweetMelissa|MySweetMelissa (User talk:MySweetMelissa|talk) 17:20, 21 May 2013 (UTC)::::We have to distinguish between who is an interesting person to know about, and what makes a worthwhile encyclopedia article. The way we do that on Wikipedia is through our Wikipedia:Notability (people)|notability guidelines. I would make the following points:::::*The reason Humility was on the ''Mayflower'' was that her guardians made the trip. They were the people who made the decision to go, not Humility. One of the notability guidelines specifically says that a person is not considered notable just because they have a relationship with someone who is notable.::::*Simple Wikipedia's articles are not mainly for young readers. They are for several classes of readers: children, yes, but also people whose first language is not English, and people with poor English skills. We do not cater to any one group over the others.::::*A person is not notable ''for Wikipedia purposes'' because of what might be discovered about them in the future.::::*Articles exist on Wikipedia based on the notability of their subject, not based on whether someone might benefit from having them there. A person is not notable because of what they experienced in their life. The passengers as a group may be notable ''for Wikipedia purposes'', certainly at least notable enough to be listed in the main article about the ship. Individuals might or might not, depending on their individual stories.::::*Wikipedia articles are, first and foremost, encyclopedia articles. They are not popular biographies or inspirational tales. Wikipedia articles deal with verifiable facts, not how much &quot;unspoken&quot; information there might be. In Humility's case, it is not a lack of facts, but a lack of notability ''according to our guidelines''.::::I am not saying that it is not worth knowing about Humility, or any other individual ''Mayflower'' passengers. I am saying that here we have specific criteria to determine who or what is notable enough for a separate article. Humility may not meet those criteria. --User:Auntof6|Auntof6 (User talk:Auntof6|talk) 06:12, 22 May 2013 (UTC)::::::I think we should revisit the basic point of notability - &quot;A person can be notable if he or she has received significant coverage in reliable secondary sources&quot;. I think all the Mayflower passengers have met that requirement. As it is an iconic historical event it is important that we give it full coverage. Also, as it is used in schools, then Wikipedia should be an accurate and informative source for students, and even more so for Simple English Wikipedia. In the specific case of Humility, until I read the article I knew nothing about her. But the article was simply written and well researched. --User:Peterdownunder|Peterdownunder (User talk:Peterdownunder|talk) 06:55, 22 May 2013 (UTC)The simplest answer &amp;ndash; on which decisions should be based &amp;ndash; is at the top of the guideline: ''A person is presumed to be notable if he or she has received ;u;significant coverage;/u; in reliable secondary sources that are independent of the subject'' (emphasis mine). This does not include trivial mentions in historical records. If the passenger has been written about extensively in multiple reliable sources, then they are notable enough to have an article. That's the guideline. It's not about whether they made an impact or did something else with their life. I don't know how much Humility Cooper features in the sources that have been provided. User:Osiris|Osiris (User talk:Osiris|talk) 06:50, 22 May 2013 (UTC):We have a list of Mayflower passengers. All we know about her as facts could be put in a short paragraph there, and linked by redirect. User:Macdonald-ross|Macdonald-ross (User talk:Macdonald-ross|talk) 07:10, 22 May 2013 (UTC)::I believe that ''Mayflower'' passengers meet WP:Notability standards because they are ''Mayflower'' passengers and all that infers to Americans, both spoken and unspoken. We see articles about persons that have done nothing notable except hold a title. While that might not be notable in some countries, it is in others and they are respected and considered notable for that reason. The WP:Notability requirement is somewhat subjective as to country but should, I believe, be respected by all countries.::While I admit there is very little known about Humility Cooper at this time, more information is being found about these early Americans all of the time. She did come over on the ''Mayflower'' and that makes her as notable as any other Mayflower passenger, in my opinion and the opinions of many others who have sustained her and other Mayflower passenger articles for years now on En-Wikipedia.::Yes, I am aware that Simple Wikipedia had slightly different goals, those to children, language challenged persons, persons to whom English is not their first language, and to others and I applaud that goal. I think Mayflower articles are appropriate for all of the persons to whom Simple Wikipedia is directed. ::I have seen many extremely complicated articles here which are near duplicates of those on EnWikipedia, unattributed and language nearly identical and have wondered to whom these articles are directed? Yet, because they pass the notability standards as interpreted by the administrators, I raise no objection.::I would think that since there is no space issue, and the ''Mayflower'' story being of such significant to both young readers and immigrants there would be no question that Humility Cooper could stay as a stand alone article and I respectfully request that she remain as such.

That being said, we need to keep in mind that this is an encyclopedia. We do not decide on keeping articles based on whether they are appropriate for our perceived audience. We have plenty of articles that are not appropriate for children. The fact that more information might be learned about someone is also not a consideration. In my opinion, the Mayflower passengers are not equally notable. The ones who had leadership roles are more notable. The ones who accomplished more later in life are more notable. Yes, our notability guidelines talk about being mentioned in publications. But if the mention is always in connection with someone else, such as a child's guardian, you have to ask how much of the notability really belongs to the child.:::As for the articles you see here that you think are questionable, question them! The administrators do not decide what meets notability guidelines, the whole community does. If you challenge something and consensus does not agree with you, you lose nothing.

If you go to [http://www.worldcat.org/search?qtworldcat_org_all&amp;qMayflower+Plymouth WorldCat], there are 1,239 books about the Mayflower. If you use [http://trove.nla.gov.au/result?qMayflower+Plymouth+Pilgrims Trove], there are an equally large number of sources. I think the sources are out there and notability is not derived from original documents proving they existed. --User:LauraHale|LauraHale (User talk:LauraHale|talk) 23:30, 25 May 2013 (UTC):::Those are books about the ship/the voyage, and most of them are secondary sources (of the 20th century). What I tried to say is: Take Humility Cooper, and leave out the &quot;boarding documents&quot; and &quot;church records&quot;. There will probably be few documents mentioning her, which were published until about 50 years after her death. She was baptized in London, in 1638 or 1639. Someone wrote in 1651 that she had died in England. It very much looks like this is all there is. Based on this record we decide that she deserves her own article here? -It looks like there were agreements signed in 1626/1627. People listed on those agreements are likely candidates for their own article.

I cannot imagine anyone not thinking any of the passengers as being notable. I also have personal knowledge that many of the immigrants that come to the US, both children and adults are extremely interested in the Mayflower and all of the early Americans and are anxious to read more about them.

User:MySweetMelissa|MySweetMelissa (User talk:MySweetMelissa|talk) 17:07, 26 May 2013 (UTC)odThose are all secondary sources. Which is exactly what you're ''supposed'' to be using when deciding notability. Why is anybody suggesting that ''primary'' sources or arbitrary criteria be used to determine whether a topic is notable? We already have a criteria. It's written at the top of WP:N. Surely, the only thing that's relevant here is whether the coverage ''in the sources'' listed on the article is enough to show notability. Not what the person did with their life. User:Osiris|Osiris (User talk:Osiris|talk) 17:15, 26 May 2013 (UTC):I also see several secondary sources (not none or just one) and I agree with those above who have pointed out that this does meet the notability criteria. Also, is there a time limit for an article to be developed here? Because if not why the rush to delete an article not yet three weeks old? I fully understand why some might find this article uninteresting but in fact the readers here are children and those learning English. So the articles by their very nature seem to fulfill two objectives; to be of interest to the readership and to be good practice for improving their language skills. I've taught children but have also taught those new to the English language and from that viewpoint this is a decent article. It serves the stated goals of Simple English Wikipedia and is an article that may still improve as other editors contribute. We develop our rules through consensus and I don't agree to applying them in the most rigid sense. All things considered I see no good reason the article should not stay. User:Rus793|Rus793 (User talk:Rus793|talk) 18:10, 26 May 2013 (UTC)::Looking at the policy on notability (significant coverage in reliable secondary sources that are independent of the subject), we have 3 things to determine, significant coverage, reliable secondary sources, independent of the subject. I doubt that anyone can honestly question the last two (hundreds of books writen by hundreds of authors and historians centuries after the subjects deaths). Only significant coverage is questionable. ''&quot;Significant coverage&quot; means that sources address the subject directly in detail''. This is where it gets tricky - ''in detail''. In much of the sources, the coverage of the &quot;not main&quot; individuals is not extensive. Not a lot is realy known about them. But for the most part, what is known about them is covered. This is not a case of them being mentioned in passing. All that is known, every detail, is often included. The lack of information still available to us should not be used to say something is not notable. This lack of information may certainly affect how we deal with the subject in other ways, but it should not affect if it is notable. Given the sheer number of secondary sources which provide most every known detail about these people, I feel notability is proven. ::Auntof6 stated above &quot;The reason Humility was on the Mayflower was that her guardians made the trip. They were the people who made the decision to go, not Humility. One of the notability guidelines specifically says that a person is not considered notable just because they have a relationship with someone who is notable.&quot; Aside from the fact that the notability here is not based on the events but on the coverage of them, it is not a question of notability being inherited. No, she did not chose to go, but Jon Benet Ramsey did not chose to be killed. ''Why'' she was a passenger does not matter, ''that'' she was one would be all that matters. Her choice (or lack of) in the situation is immaterial.::That all being said, I do agree, in part, with Eptalon. While there is no doubt to me that Humility is notable, I do not feel there is ample information of warrant her own article at this time. A page listing all of the passengers with the known information about them with links to full articles on those where enough information is known to warrant full articles would probably be a better way to handle this. A page similar to the various &quot;Characters of ;blah;&quot; pages would be best. People like Humility, while notable are merely bit players in the history of the events - they are minor characters of history. Character list pages handle the major and minor characters in a fashion where the information of most characters is available - pertinent info for all with just a summary for the major characters with a link to the rest of the information we have (the main article).::'''tl;dr''': Yep, they are notable, but not enough info available of many of them for separate articles. Merge into a &quot;character list&quot; style page. --;b;User:Creol|Creol;/b;;small;(User_talk:Creol|talk);/small; 13:01, 27 May 2013 (UTC):::The Simple English Wikipedia Notability guideline, under General Notability Guideline states: &quot;Significant coverage is more than trivial but may be less than exclusive&quot;. As for degrees of notability, they can't all be Charlemagne or other famous historical figures and I also don't see degrees of notability mentioned in the guideline. In the List of Mayflower passengers a link to her page is desirable but that list has hardly a sentence on those without articles of their own. Also, the point wasn't addressed why are we even discussing this on an article not three weeks old when this was brought up. What happened to letting the article develop and allow other editors to edit and add information? We don't know these are the only sources available on her so why the rush to judgement? Common sense should tell us this is a conversation for some time in the future after the article and others like it have been allowed time to develop. It's a good article and I definitely think it should stay. User:Rus793|Rus793 (User talk:Rus793|talk) 17:24, 29 May 2013 (UTC)Some of these characters don't deserve a separate article. The only stuff known about them is birth, baptismal, marriage, and death dates. Most lived the ordinary lives of settlers -- tilling the fields, eating, sleeping, praying, and making babies. This is not enough to merit a stand-alone article puffed up with speculation, 19th century oil pictures of the first Thanksgiving, and long paragraphs about the uncomfortable conditions on the Mayflower.

This stuff is of interest only to genel. and desc. of pilgrims who (for some baffling reason) need to know every itty-bitty detail about their illustrious ancestors.

Hello there,As I already announced on the admin noticeboard, I am in the process of developing a bot to archive/delete &quot;stale&quot; DYK nominations. This bot expects a given format, which was the format that the &quot;news items&quot; were level four headings, and that we had level three headings which are &quot;categories&quot; (such as Arts, and Nature). I would prefer to re-introduce that format: An empty section &quot;Arts&quot; might likely entice people to nominate an Arts-related hook, which would mean that in the end we have a &quot;more varied&quot; DYK. At the time of this writing, there are seven hooks I think. One could be classified as Math/Thech/Engineering-related, the others would be &quot;People&quot; hooks. I am stopping work on my bot, until we reach an agreement on the format. --User:Eptalon|Eptalon (User talk:Eptalon|talk) 18:10, 15 June 2013 (UTC):The categories made sense when there was a backlog. Now that DYK is back to more reasonable (and typical) numbers they are pointless; they were not particularly well defined, there is far too much overlap and the page looked a mess, imo at least. It certainly did not seem a useful way to proceed, but it did have a purpose when we had so many unreviewed nominations. I'm also not sure what point there is in making a bot to archive old nominations. Again, there are that few nominations that it seems a waste; DYK has survived for nearly 5 years on a manual basis, aside from the one recent backlog incident.

I see no need for them particularly when they will be largely empty. It's redundancy that just isn't needed here, and I don't buy that point about them inciting people to write about specific topics. People will stumble on DYK and write whatever they want to: an empty category isn't going to promote that, and all it does is make DYK seem stagnant when large numbers are empty. The only reason that we get mainly hooks about people are because those are the ones that people nominate: they don't have to (because most of the time people are just finding already sourced facts) but that is what is happening - with or without categories. If we want to promote a wider diversity, let's slap on a restriction that the user has to have written/contributed to the article they're nominating... although that will probably kill of DYK.

User:Osiris|Osiris (User talk:Osiris|talk) 02:32, 30 May 2013 (UTC)::Yes, I've commented elsewhere on how the USGS colours are better for screen use than the ICS colours. A blaze of vivid colours might be suitable for a wallchart, but it is not suitable for screen viewing. Many of the ICS colours obscure the print, and lower readability. It is irrelevant whether the system is American or not; we make decisions based on our perception of what improves our pages. ;br/;On a related point, I suggest that templates should usually be set up so they present to the reader in closed format. Both graphics and text should not interfere too much with the flow of test, which is the primary content of a page.

Hello, List of cities in Western Sahara is a listing of settlements, with their approximate location, the controlling county, and two population counts. There are problems though:*Most of the 30-odd settlements are red-links*In many cases, the population is not known*In the case of La Güera, the population of about 3.500 people is probably wrong; the city is basically a ghost town, home perhaps to a few fishermen. La Güera lies in the desert, the main problemwhich led to the city being abandoned is sand.Since the terrirory of western Sahara is split between three contorlling countries, and that there is a (probably low-intensity) conflict, getting accurate figures for anything outside the Moroccan-controlled part will porbably be impossible. Knowing this, the big question becomes what to do:*Try to find population number for the cities?*Remove all the entries where nothing is known except the city name?*Delete the &quot;List&quot;, if less than 5-6 cities are left?This posting is to start a discussion; I think this is better here, than in an RFD, because it does not suggest an outcome...--User:Eptalon|Eptalon (User talk:Eptalon|talk) 09:42, 22 June 2013 (UTC):Well, one could delete the list box, move the page to Towns in Western Sahara, and just put a list of those cities which are blue-linked plus any red-links which are notable.

These city states are at the same administrative level with the other Bundesländer (Baden-Würtemberg, Brandenburg, Hessen, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Niedersachsen, Nordrheinwestfalen, Rheinland-Pfalz, Saarland, Sachsen, Sachsen-Anhalt, Schleswig-Holstein, and Thüringen). And no, the capital of Brandenburg is Potsdam, not Berlin; that of Niedersachsen is Hannover, not Hamburg or Bremen; so the case where one city serves as capital for two entities does not exist, except for Berlin, which is also the capital of Germany. Then there are (Landkreise) and Kreisfreise Städte, a Kreisfreie Stadt is basically its own Landkreis; there are exceptions here: Hannover is such a Kreisfreie Stadt, but at the same time it is the capital (and part of) the &quot;Landkreis&quot; Region Hannover. To distinguish from a normal Landkreis, whose capital is not a kreisfreie Stadt, Region Hannover is called: &quot;Kommunalverband besonderer Art&quot; (this construct also exists for Saarbrücken (&quot;Regionalverband Saarbrücken&quot;) and Aachen (&quot;Städteregion Aachen&quot;)).

I've been adding some manually now and then, and I was wondering about this. I partly hope there is something automated, because it would be helpful. However, I partly hope there isn't, because there isn't a one-to-one match across Wikipedias. Whether there is or not, I'd like to mention the following for those who may not have thought about it. As I understand things regarding Wikidata's interwiki links:*Categories, templates, and pages in mainspace can be entered in the interwiki part of Wikidata. If you enter categories or templates, be sure to put &quot;Category:&quot; or &quot;Template:&quot; at the start of the page name. Otherwise, it might match a category or template to an article because Wikidata doesn't know the difference.*Interwiki matches in Wikidata are by content, not page name. This can be tricky for us, since our pages don't have to be named the same as on English Wikipedia and pages with the same name can be about different things. For example, :en:Field theory is a disambiguation page, but here Field theory is not, so those pages do not match even though they have the same name.*If a page is in Wikidata with interwikis, and that page is moved/renamed, Wikidata needs to be updated to show the new name.*Only complete matches should be entered in Wikidata. For example, if we have a page about a person who doesn't have their own page on other Wikipedias, that page doesn't match another Wikipedia's article about their family or some other group they're in.*Wikidata doesn't want interwiki links to sections like you might have seen in the past.*If you enter an interwiki link manually in Wikidata, look at what's in the edit box before you save. Wikidata likes to guess what article you're typing in, and sometimes it adds characters you haven't typed. Before you save your entry, make sure it says what you want.Just some thoughts. --User:Auntof6|Auntof6 (User talk:Auntof6|talk) 09:29, 4 June 2013 (UTC):Not really any bots doing it yet. I think because they are still pulling in interwiki links that are already on pages. From what I understand once that is done they will turn their attention to new pages. For now you need to go manually. -User:Djsasso|DJSasso (User talk:Djsasso|talk) 14:02, 4 June 2013 (UTC)::From my experience, there are bots that watch when pages are moved and update Wikidata accordingly.

Warren was 21 years old, convert|32|in|cm tall, and weighed convert|29|lb. Barnum billed her as &quot;The Queen of Beauty&quot;. Nutt developed an &quot;adolescent crush&quot; on her, but Nutt would be disappointed.sfn|Saxon|1989|pp208-209Barnum gave Lavinia a diamond and emerald ring. It did not fit her finger properly, so he told her to give the ring to Nutt as a token of her friendship. Nutt regarded the ring as a token of her love instead. He fell more in love with her than ever. Lavinia was uncomfortable with his attentions.

More information will turn up, I'm certain, but I believe there is enough information now to make a good article on Commodore Nutt. His story is heartening and tells me that those who may be perceived by some as disabled can make a productive life for him or herself and may even find great fame and fortune. I hope others will enjoy reading this article as much as I enjoyed writing it! I look forward to your comments and will respond at once. User:Oregonian2012|Oregonian2012 (User talk:Oregonian2012|talk) 23:58, 17 July 2013 (UTC):I'll have a good read of this tomorrow. Very good-looking article, as we've come to expect from Oregonian. References all look reliable with a single exception - [http://nutfieldgenealogy.blogspot.com.au/2011/06/commodore-nutt-lived-in-fame-but-died.html this one] needs replacing - unless Heather Rojo is considered a reliable source in this field, it's a personal webpage. Will comment further after I've had a proper read through. User:Osiris|Osiris (User talk:Osiris|talk) 11:35, 18 July 2013 (UTC)::I will say I really enjoyed reading the article! I didn't review links, but core content is very nice.::In my opinion, by the way, ''if you can't find a better source'' in place of Heather Rojo, I'd be ok with that one in the context of all the other high-quality sources here. It would probably interfere with VGA, but I don't think needs to interfere with GA.::Vocabulary-wise, I think you're in great shape. I'd only change two words. There isn't a link to ''bruited'' on ''simplewiki'' or ''simplewikt,'' and that's a pretty non-simple word. (I have a large vocabulary, and I had never really seen it in English before this, though I understood it from French.) And while &quot;Lilliputian Love Triangle&quot; is a charming heading, you can't really do that without a link on Lilliputian&amp;mdash;and we usually don't like links in headers. I'd defer to those more experienced than I on that question.::Sentence structure is not simple yet, however. I think we'd all go stir-crazy if we never used subordinate clauses here. But you still have a lot of them. There are a couple of editors/admins here who are good and fast at this, but I don't mind helping out myself (though probably not today).::Question for more experienced hands: A couple of pictures seem odd here. I appreciate wanting to illustrate concepts when possible. But the photo of Lincoln (especially) and the photo of the NYC Police Commissioners don't really have anything to do with Nutt's interactions with them. Are they relevant here?::Terrific start, Oregonian! User:StevenJ81|StevenJ81 (User talk:StevenJ81|talk) 12:03, 18 July 2013 (UTC)::Did a quick read and liked it.

Great job on the references, all look reliable. The only one thing I would mention is that there are quite a few quotations, however brief, with quite complex terms (I had to look up what &quot;drollery&quot; meant). There are several possible ways of dealing with these: you could rewrite them in your own, simpler words, while still attributing them as indirect quotes; or you could append a brief explanation of what they meant; or you could link the terms to Wiktionary. Whatever you do, they're short and used sparingly so it's not a deal-breaker for a good article as far as I'm concerned.

They are both the same and are referenced in a very short paragraph. You only need one at the end of the paragraph. * A careful reading of the article will reveal &quot;style&quot; shortcomings and confusions like this: &quot;Although in favor of freedom of the press, ''Mandela was important of much'' of the country's media.&quot; I don't get this. And here: &quot;As South Africa's first black President[16][17], Mandela became ...&quot;. Properly the citations belong after the punctuation. When I find time, I'll list others here.* I would like to see a Background sort of thing before I give this article the thumbs up. Mandela comes from a complex culture of African village life. This village life is not what one would find in Western village life. His father had four wives, for example. In the western world this would called &quot;polygamy&quot; and regarded with some questions and reservations. In western life, it may even be illegal. In African village life however this appears to be legal and a normal way of life. Some authorities have indicated this village culture affected his entire life. It is likely unfamiliar to many, many readers. He is a world figure. He may die soon. This article will be accessed by many, many people at his death, especially American school children who will probably be given assignments to write a paper on Mandela. I think it essential that this village culture be briefly explained in the article. It doesn't need to be exhaustive or lengthy, but it should give the reader a good sense of Mandela's &quot;roots&quot;. There are many biographies of Mandela available in public and academic libraries and on Google Books. Mandela has written at least two autobiographies. I am surprised that these materials have not be referenced in creating this article. This article must be exemplary because Mandela is going to die and many children will be accessing this article.

I have been slowly working on simplifying the article on Simple English Wikipedia. I made the sentences less complex. I tried to use simpler language. (I think I did this well, but if not, please make suggestions for improvement. Simplifying some complex ideas is difficult.) For some of the specialized ski words, I created stub articles that explained more about a topic so there would not be so many red links. The article is fully sourced. It covers the topic comprehensively. I think it is an important article to work on with the 2014 Winter Paralympics coming up. I think it should be a GA because of the things I talked about. User:LauraHale|LauraHale (User talk:LauraHale|talk) 21:13, 12 September 2013 (UTC)First scan: * In simplifying the article, it has become almost incomprehensible in some places. This, for example: &quot;Para-alpine skiing is an adjustment of alpine skiing ''for with'' a disability, a condition of being unable.&quot; And this: &quot;With ''a upright'' drop of 300 metres (980 ft) to 400 metres (1,300 ft), this is one of ''the more need to be very correct when turning'' the para-alpine disciplines&quot;. And this: &quot;A factoring system ''was made come into existence'' for para-alpine skiing.&quot; Some sentences are too long for Simple like this: &quot;In this type, skiers going over snow quickly between alternating red and blue gates that are 25 metres (82 ft) apart, with men needing to go between 35 gates and women needing to go between 30 gates.&quot; Also there is an abundance of red links. User:Oregonian2012|Oregonian2012 (User talk:Oregonian2012|talk) 01:06, 14 September 2013 (UTC)** I think I have addressed all the grammatical errors and simplification issues you have mentioned. On the issue of redlinks, the remaining ones are all about proper nouns. I have included them for two reasons: 1) I want to know what articles I should be working on creating, 2) I think they would be useful articles to have to allow people to know more about disability sport but are not fundamental to understanding, from a Simple English point of view, the article topic.--User:LauraHale|LauraHale (User talk:LauraHale|talk) 06:01, 14 September 2013 (UTC)*I am also seeing some very awkward phrases. For example, in the section on classification, some of the descriptions in the tables either don't make sense or are poorly worded. Sometimes we have to use words that might not be on the various lists of Basic English words. For example, &quot;elbow&quot; is much simpler than &quot;angle of arm&quot;, and most readers will know what that is even if the word isn't on any of the lists. Take a look at the change I just made for more examples. I will look at more of the article when I get a chance. --User:Auntof6|Auntof6 (User talk:Auntof6|talk) 02:25, 14 September 2013 (UTC)**Further thoughts: one way to simplify a long article is to leave out parts that don't contribute as much to understanding the subject. For example, the section on &quot;types of skiing&quot; seems to have a lot of general information that isn't specific to the &quot;para&quot; aspects of the sport. To me, that could be trimmed. (I think it could be trimmed in the English article, too.) --User:Auntof6|Auntof6 (User talk:Auntof6|talk) 21:42, 14 September 2013 (UTC)*** I had thought possibly that there might be a good case for putting some of that information into separate articles: creating a new article about downhill skiing, slalom skiing, giant slalom skiing, etc. Some of the information applies to alpine skiing in general. (Though not always. They adapt courses for people with disabilities. There have been cases where sit-skiers have done test runs down a competition course and broke their backs because the landing was so hard. The same course has no problems for able-bodied skiers. ) If the issues are too many, I would be okay with withdrawing the nomination. I had thought I had done a much better job at simplifying and fault would be mine. I still obviously need work at simplifying and will continue to work towards that. --User:LauraHale|LauraHale (User talk:LauraHale|talk) 10:13, 15 September 2013 (UTC)****We already have an overall article on alpine skiing. You could just refer to that one, either with a &quot;main article&quot; tag or by creating separate redirects.;br/;I'm trying to think of how to help you learn to do this kind of simplifying, other than by critiquing what you do. I could point you to articles I simplified from enwiki, or I could re-simplify part of this article. I'm not saying my work is perfect, either, but it would give you examples. Let me know. --User:Auntof6|Auntof6 (User talk:Auntof6|talk) 14:09, 15 September 2013 (UTC)*Continuation of my comment on Simple Talk::However, I ran it through the other software, and got a much lower score: 52.6 on the Flesch scale, and grade level 10.4, years of formal education 11.7. Then I read some more of the text. Overall, I think the prose is rather clunky. On that alone I would say the article is not GA. One way to proceed is to use the first formula on my page, and go through the sentences it suggests you revise. Another way is to get a few young persons of secondary school age to read through it &amp; underline things that are not clear. Although it's just a personal opinion, I think (like many pages brought over from En wiki) that it is rather too detailed and complicated for our readership. A more ruthless weeding would improve it.

We don't have an opera in the VGA archives and I am willing to work on this article to get it there. Because we don't have an article in the VGA archives, I don't have a model. Nor do other editors. IMHO, we need some classic operas and ballets in the VGA archives to serve as models for other editors and in the rotation on the Main Page. I need suggestions for improvement. The '''Flesch Reading Ease is 62.08 and the Flesch Kincaid Grade level 7.01'''. I don't think the article at Simple needs long lists of aria and ensemble titles in Italian. Do you? Actually I think the article grades high because of the polysyllabic Italian words in the article. However, I can't see ridding the article of the few that are there. At Simple, the Italian should be kept to the essential minimum to maintain the Reading Ease. I'm not sure our readers need an &quot;Orchestration&quot; section though both paper encyclopedias and enwiki have this sort of section. But these encyclopedias are not written at an 8th grade level either. I'm not sure those reading at an 8th grade level need such as section. The orchestra in most operas and ballets are the standard orchestra of the day: strings, winds, brass, and percussion. This is why I need your help.

Anyway, I fixed a couple of small things. You linked &quot;interference&quot;, but that article is about a specific scientific meaning of the word, not the meaning the article needed. (You really have to watch for words that have more than one meaning -- there are so many of them in English, and even words that are listed on the Basic English lists are only basic for some of their meanings.)

There are a lot of compound sentences. (If you don't understand what a compound sentence is, just ask -- I won't think badly of you!) Some of the easy ones to identify are where there are two sentences joined with semicolons, and some where they're joined by dashes. However, there are more besides those. Here's an example::::::::Reagan's favorite acting role was as a double amputee in 1942's Kings Row, in which he recites the line, &quot;Where's the rest of me?&quot;, later used as the title of his 1965 autobiography.::::::That sentence should be divided into at least three shorter ones.:::::: I also see some places that need copy editing. For example, &quot;Although he used to be a Democrat who strongly supported the New Deal and admired Franklin Roosevelt.&quot; isn't a complete sentence. There are places that have some words that could be removed (in &quot;They both became good friends&quot;, the word &quot;both&quot; is redundant). There are some misplaced modifiers. There is a link to the dab page Debut, which should probably be changed to a simpler word anyway.

I think that makes it rather bland. I would agree that it's difficult to summarise his politics, but without question it's an issue a reader would expect to see in the intro. Both Reagan and Margaret Thatcher had rather similar liberal-conservative economic policies, perhaps influenced by such as Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman.

These were the Commonwealth countries.There were many more countries that she also ruled, because they belonged to the British Empire. One by one, many of the countries became independent, and as they gained independence she became Queen of many of them. Altogether, she was sovereign of 32 nations.Some of the countries are now republics and have a president as &quot;Head of State&quot;, while some of them keep the Queen as &quot;Head of State&quot;. Queen Elizabeth II is the only monarch of more than one independent nation. The old British Empire became the Commonwealth of Nations.It includes both monarchies and republics. It is now called &quot;The Commonwealth&quot;. The Queen is the Head of the Commonwealth. She works hard to keep peace and good communication between all the nations that are members. Relationships with her governments and other countries Ever since she became the Queen, Elizabeth has spent about three hours every day &quot;doing the boxes&quot;. The &quot;boxes&quot; are two large red boxes that are brought to her from the Parliament every day. They are full of state papers sent to her from her various departments, embassies, and government offices.;Information supplied by the Royal Household to a parliamentary inquiry into the workings of the monarchy in the early 1970s.; One of the most famous photos taken of Elizabeth as a teenager shows her with her father, the King, learning about &quot;the boxes&quot;. Because she has been doing this since 1952, she knows a great deal about the government of the UK.File:Elizabeth II, Buckingham Palace, 07 Mar 2006.jpeg|thumb|At a state banquet at Buckingham palace, Her Majesty wears the Grand Collar of the Brazilian ''Order of the Southern Cross'' and a necklace of Brazilian aquamarines.When the Queen is in London, she meets her Prime Minister once a week, to talk about events. She also has meetings with the First Minister of Scotland and other Ministers of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, and the Prime Ministers and Ministers of other countries, when she is in their country, or when they visit London.In the late 1990s, there were &quot;referendums&quot; in which the people of Scotland and Wales were asked if they wanted parliaments that were separate from the parliament of the United Kingdom. This was called a &quot;devolution policy&quot;. As a result, the new Scottish Parliament and the National Assembly of Wales, were set up. The Queen opened the first sessions of these two bodies.Recently, some people in Australia want a republic, with an elected or appointed President as Head of State instead of the Queen. In 1999, the people of Australia were asked in a referendum whether they wanted a republic. The decision of the people was to remain a monarchy. The Queen visited Australia the following year and said that she would continue to serve Australians as she had done for 48 years.Elizabeth II is friends with many world leaders. Her first Prime Minister of Australia, Sir Robert Menzies called her &quot;My Dear&quot; and recited a poem that said &quot;I will love her till I die&quot;. She has friendships with Mary Robinson, President of Ireland (1990-1997) and George W. Bush, who was the first President of the United States|American President in more than 80 years to stay at Buckingham Palace.

She is very interested in the Church of England, but the Archbishop of Canterbury runs the church. She rarely attends the yearly meeting of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland.The Queen is deeply religious. In her Christmas Day television broadcast in 2000, she said: cquote|To many of us, our beliefs are of fundamental importance. For me, the teachings of Christ, and my own personal accountability before God provide a framework in which I try to lead my life.

Her father, King George VI, was not meant to be king. Her uncle became king when her grandfather died. But he fell in love with an American woman who was divorced, and that wasn't allowed. So he had to give up being king very shortly after ascending. George VI didn't want to be king, because he was quite nervous and had a stammer. However, Elizabeth's grandfather said that he didn't think her uncle was very good as a king, and wanted George to reign, then Elizabeth. From the moment she realised that one day she would be Queen, she became very interested in her duties and did all she could to help her father. Her promise to serve her people all her life has always been very important to her. Some people think that now that she is old, perhaps she will retire (&quot;abdicate&quot;) and let her son Prince Charles take over. People who know her well, including Prince Charles, have said that this will never happen.;cite web| url  http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4921120.stm| title  Queen 'will do her job for life'| publisher  BBC News| date19 April 2006| accessdate  4 February 2007; Courage File:ElizabethIItroopingcolour.jpg|thumb|250px|The Queen with Prince Charles and Prince Philip at the &quot;Trooping the Colour&quot; in 1986, riding her favourite horse, Burmese.The Queen has often shown courage, ever since she joined the military at 18. During a trip to Ghana in 1961, she was warned that it was dangerous to be near the President Kwame Nkrumah because people wanted to kill him. But she refused to stay away. The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Harold Macmillan, wrote that the Queen got very impatient with people if they tried to treat her like &quot;a film star&quot;.In 1964, when the Queen was invited to Quebec, there were fears for her safety because there was opposition to her visit. There were suggestions that the tour should be cancelled.

It was later discovered that the shots were blanks. In 1982, a man called Michael Fagan broke into Buckingham Palace in the morning, and found the Queen's bedroom. He woke her up, and sat on her bed, until the guards came to take him away. Family relations Throughout her long reign, Queen Elizabeth II has been supported in her duties by her husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. Prince Philip promised to help the Queen on the day of her Coronation. The Queen was also helped by her mother Queen Elizabeth, known as &quot;The Queen Mother&quot;, who lived to be 101 years old, and stayed very active in her old-age. The Queen is the patron of many organisations and charities. She has many invitations and official duties. Many of the duties have been shared by other members of the Royal Family, who have also become patrons of many organisations.File:Trooping the Colour, Saturday June 16th 2007.jpg|thumb|left|250px| The Queen and Prince Philip with some of their family on the balcony of Buckingham Palace, 2007.

The Queen was sad about the broken marriages and divorces of three of her children, Prince Charles, Princess Anne and Prince Andrew. Prince Charles's marriage to Lady Diana Spencer was thought to be a fairytale wedding because she was young and beautiful. But it soon became unhappy, and after their divorce, she was killed in a car accident in 1997. On 9 April 2005, Prince Charles married Camilla Parker-Bowles, whom he had loved for many years. In the year 2002, within a few months of each other, the Queen's mother and sister, Princess Margaret, both died.As the Queen is old, people worry about her health, but she is rarely sick. However, she is leaving more duties to the younger members of the Royal Family, particularly to Prince Charles, who will become monarch on her death.File:Balmoral Castle.jpg|thumb|Balmoral Castle in Scotland is one of the Queen's homes. Wealth The Queen's wealth is private. It is difficult to estimate how much she is worth. She owns Sandringham House, Balmoral Castle, and other large properties.

The &quot;Yurovsky Note&quot; was a description of the event by Yurovsky after the execution. According to the note, on the night of the murders the family was awakened and told to dress. They were told they were moving to a new place for their safety. They claimed it was because of the possible violence which might happen when the White Army reached Yekaterinburg. When they were dressed, the family and the few servants were led to a small room in the house's basement. They were told to wait there. Alexandra asked for chairs for herself and Alexei, and she sat next to her son. After a short time, the executioners entered the room, led by Yurovsky. Yurovsky quickly told the Tsar and his family that they were going to die. The Tsar cried &quot;What?&quot; and turned to his family, but was immediately killed when several bullets hit his chest. The Tsar, the empress, and two servants were killed in the first round of shooting. Maria, Dr. Botkin and Alexandra's maid Demidova were hurt. Thick smoke and dust filled the room from the shooting, so the gunmen left the room for a few minutes. They soon came back and shot Dr. Botkin.

From 1920 to 1922, Anna Anderson, the most famous person who pretended to be Anastasia, grew very famous.

Instead, they told them they had been moved to a safer place.;Alexeev, V.V., &quot;Last Act of a Tragedy&quot;, documents from German government files found by Sokolov.; This could have been why the 'Perm stories' began.Another time, eight people said that they saw a young woman being captured at a railway station at Siding 37 in September 1918 after trying to escape. These people were Maxim Grigoyev, Tatiana Sitnikova and her son Fyodor Sitnikov, Ivan Kuklin and Matrina Kuklina, Vassily Ryabov, Ustinya Varankina, and Dr. Pavel Utkin.;Occleshaw (1993), p. 46; Some of these people said that the girl was Anastasia when they saw photographs of the grand duchess by White Russian Army investigators. Dr. Pavel Utkin also told the investigators that the girl, whom he had helped in Perm when she was hurt, had said, &quot;I am the daughter of the ruler, Anastasia.&quot; During that time, there were similar stories of young people in Russia saying that they were Romanovs who had escaped. Boris Soloviev, the husband of Rasputin's daughter Maria, cheating|defrauded many important Russian families by asking for money for a Romanov to escape to China. Soloviev was helped by young women who pretended to be one of the grand duchesses to help trick the families.;Occleshaw (1993), p. 47;Some suggest that there might have been a way for a guard to save anyone in the family who still lived. Yakov Yurovsky ordered the guards to come to his office and give him the things they had stolen after the murder. At that time, it is said that there was a short time when the killed bodies were left in the truck and in the basement of the house. Some guards who had not joined in the murders and had felt sorry for the grand duchesses were left in the basement with the bodies.;King and Wilson (2003), p. 314;There were also stories from Bulgaria that Anastasia and her brother were still alive. In 1953, Peter Zamiatkin told a 16-year-old person being treated at a hospital that he had taken Anastasia and Alexei to the village where he was born near Odessa. He said he was a member of the guard of the Romanovs, and that the Tsar had asked him to do this. Zamiatkin said that after the rest of the family had been killed, he escaped with the children on a ship. &quot;Anastasia&quot; and &quot;Alexei&quot; lived under false names in the Bulgarian town of Gabarevo.

The Russians used a computer program to compare photos of Anastasia with the skulls from the grave.

The earliest, made in 1928, was called ''Clothes Make the Woman''. The story was about a woman who acts the character of Anastasia in a Hollywood movie, and is later recognized by the Russian soldier who saved her.In 1956, a movie called Anastasia (1956 movie)|''Anastasia'' was made. Ingrid Bergman acted Anna Anderson, Yul Brynner was General Bounine (a fictional character based on several real men), and Helen Hayes as the Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Dowager Empress Marie, Anastasia's grandmother. The movie is about a woman from an asylum who came to Paris in 1928 and was captured by some Russian émigrés who use her so that they can fool Anastasia's grandmother into thinking Anderson actually is her granddaughter. This is because they want to get a Tsarist fortune. After some time, they begin wondering if &quot;Madame A. Anderson&quot; really is the missing Grand Duchess.This story was also used for the short 1965 musical ''Anya''.In 1986, NBC began a Miniseries|mini-series inspired by a book published in 1983 by Peter Kurth called ''Anastasia: The Riddle of Anna Anderson''. The movie, ''Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna'', was a series with two parts. It began with the young Anastasia Nicholaievna and her family being sent to Yekaterinburg, where they are killed by Bolshevik soldiers. The story then moves to 1923, saying that Anna Anderson is Anastasia. Amy Irving was the actress for Anna Anderson.;Plander, Judy. &quot;'Anastasia' Is Marvelous&quot;. ''Ocala Star-Banner'', December 8, 1986. Retrieved December 9, 2010.;The most recent movie is 1997's ''Anastasia''. This was an animation|animated musical adaptation of the story of Anastasia's fictional (not real) escape from Russia and how she tried to be recognized. The movie often used wrong historical facts.In ''The Romanov Prophecy,'' a 2004 novel by Steve Berry (novelist)|Steve Berry, Anastasia and Alexei are saved by guards and taken away to the United States. There, they live under false names with a family paid by Felix Yusupov. In the novel, both children died in the 1920s because they became sick. However, before they died, Alexei married and had a son.

The wheel belongs to the goddess Fortuna (mythology)|Fortuna, who spins it at random, changing the positions of those on the wheel - some suffer great misfortune, others gain windfalls.OriginsThe concept developed in ancient history|antiquity; it was used by Cicero. The Wheel originally belonged to the Roman goddess Fortuna, whose name seems to derive from ''Vortumna'', &quot;she who revolves the year&quot;. Fortuna eventually became Christianized: the Ancient Rome|Roman philosopher Boethius (d. 524) was a major source for the medieval view of the Wheel, writing about it in his''Consolation of Philosophy|Consolatio Philosophiae''.Carmina BuranaFile:CarminaBurana wheel.jpg|thumb|250px|The wheel of fortune from the ''Burana Codex''; The figures are labelled &quot;Regno, Regnavi, Sum sine regno, Regnabo&quot;: I reign, I reigned, My reign is finished, I shall reignThe Wheel of Fortune motif appears significantly in the ''Carmina Burana'' (or ''Burana Codex''), over one thousand poems and songs — often profane in content — written by students and clergy in the early 13th century. Excerpts from two of the collection's better known poems, &quot;''Fortuna Imperatrix Mundi'' (Fortune, Empress of the World)&quot; and &quot;''Fortune Plango Vulnera'' (I Bemoan the Wounds of Fortune),&quot; read:: ''Sors immanis '' : ''et inanis, '' : ''rota tu volubilis'', : ''status malus,'' : ''vana salus'' : ''semper dissolubilis,'' : ''obumbrata '' : ''et velata'' : ''michi quoque niteris; '' : ''nunc per ludum'' : ''dorsum nudum'' : ''fero tui sceleris.'' : . . . . . . . . . . : ''Fortune rota volvitur;'' : ''descendo minoratus;'' : ''alter in altum tollitur;'' : ''nimis exaltatus '' : ''rex sedet in vertice'' : ''caveat ruinam! '' : ''nam sub axe legimus '' : ''Hecubam reginam.'': Fate - monstrous : and empty, : you whirling wheel,: you are malevolent, : well-being is vain : and always fades to nothing,: shadowed: and veiled: you plague me too;: now through the game: I bring my bare back: to your villainy.: . . . . . . . . . : The wheel of Fortune turns;: I go down, demeaned;: another is raised up;: far too high up: sits the king at the summit -: let him fear ruin!: for under the axis is written: Queen Hecuba.Later usageFortune and her Wheel have remained an enduring image throughout history.William Shakespeare in ''Hamlet'' wrote of the &quot;slings and arrows of outrageous fortune&quot; and, of fortune personified, to &quot;break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel.&quot; And in ''Henry V (play)|Henry V'', [http://www.online-literature.com/shakespeare/henryV/16/ Act 3 Scene VI], are the lines:Selections from the ''Carmina Burana'', including the two poems quoted above, were set to new music by twentieth-century classical composer Carl Orff, whose bombastic and well-known &quot;Carmina Burana (Orff)|O Fortuna&quot; is based on the poem ''Fortuna Imperatrix Mundi.Fortuna does occasionally turn up in modern literature. She is often associated with gamblers, and dice could also be said to have replaced the Wheel as the primary metaphor for uncertain fortune.References*''Boethius, [http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new?idBoePhil&amp;imagesimages/modeng&amp;data/texts/english/modeng/parsed&amp;tagpublic&amp;part2&amp;divisiondiv ''The Consolation of Philosophy'']'', trans.

It ends with the Lantern Festival 14 days later. This occurs around the time of the full moon as each complete moon cycle is about 29.53 days long. In the Gregorian calendar used in other country|countries, Chinese New Year falls on different dates each year. It is usually between January 21 and February 20. This means that the holiday usually starts on the second (sometimes the third) new moon after the winter solstice. Animal zodiacs The dates for the Spring Festival from 1996 to 2019 (in the Gregorian calendar) are at the right. The list also includes the year's animal zodiac and it's earthly branch. The names of the earthly branches have no English language|English translations. They are not chinese language|Chinese translations of the animals. The calendar has a 12-year cycle of the animal zodiac and a 10-year cycle of ''heavenly stems''. Each of the ten heavenly stems is associated with one of the five elements of Chinese astrology. These elements are Wood, Fire, dirt|Earth, Metal, and Water. The elements are changed every two years and a yin and yang association changes every year. The elements are named: Yang Wood, Yin Wood, Yang Fire, Yin Fire, and so on. These two cycles create a combined cycle that repeats every 60 years. For example, 1936 was the year of the Yang Fire Rat. 60 years later, 1996 was the next year of the Yang Fire Rat. Differences Some people have problems with the difference between the Chinese birth-year and the Gregorian birth-year. Because the Chinese New Year starts in late January or early February, the Chinese year begins several weeks after it begins in the Gregorian calendar. If a person is born in early January, their Chinese birth-year is the last Gregorian year, not the current one. This causes problems because many people think of the years as the same. For example, 1989 was the year of the Snake. The year 1990 was the year of the Horse. It began on 26 January 1990. This means that anyone born from January 1 to January 25, 1990, was actually born in the year of the Snake not the year of the Horse.File:Hong_Kong_firework_show.jpg|thumb|Hong Kong firework show|203x203px Comparison Chinese New Year is a great festival to Chinese. But it is celebrated differently in China and the West. People in China normally take at least three days off. They go to see a colorful church fair in Beijing and to see martial arts performances.

It had a total of 100 episodes.Basic story''DuckTales'' is about the adventures of Scrooge and his nephews. The nephews used to live with their uncle, Donald Duck. They were left with Scrooge when Donald went off to join the Navy.Scrooge is the richest duck in the world. He has no want for anything. This does not stop him from finding ways to try to get more money. Other common plots deal with him protecting his wealth from villains. In general, there were several different plotlines that were used many time in many of the episodes. Some of these plotlines included:* Scrooge learns about an ancient treasure or civilization. When he goes to find it, he finds more trouble than he thought he would find. (''Home Sweet Homer'', Master of the Djinni, ''Sweet Duck of Youth'', ''A Ducktale's Valentine'')* In a similar plot, Scrooge is having trouble with one of his businesses. When he goes to fix the problem, he gets involved in an adventure of some sort. (''Where No Duck Has Gone Before'', ''Bermuda Triangle Tangle'', ''Ducks of the West'', ''Back Out in the Outback'')* Gyro creates a new machine|invention. The invention usually either causes problems when it does not work properly or it is stolen and used for evil. (''Armstrong'', ''Bubba's Big Brainstorm'', ''Time Teasers'')* Scrooge loses all of his money, often to the Beagle Boys, and tries to get it back. This plotline is often used with one of the other common plotlines. (''The Money Vanishes'', ''Scrooge's Last Adventure'', ''Time is Money'')* Flintheart Glomgold tries to become better than Scrooge. This usually deals with Glomgold trying to become the richest duck in the world. (''Duckman of Aquatraz'', ''The Uncrashable Hindentanic'', ''The Attack of the Metal Mites'')* Magica de Spell tries to steal the first money that Scrooge ever earned. This is his first dime, which he calls his &quot;Number One Dime&quot;. Her plans involve using the special dime to create a magic spell that will give her great wealth. (''Send in the Clones'', ''Nothing to Fear'', ''Magica's Shadow War'').* Scrooge remembers some business, sailing|voyages or adventures from when he was young. (''Ducktales:Treasure of the Golden Suns'', ''Duck in the Iron Mask'', ''Status Seeker'', ''Launchpad's First Crash'', ''Once Upon a Dime'', ''The Curse of Castle McDuck'', ''Back to the Klondike'', ''Super DuckTales'').CharactersHeroes* Scrooge McDuck is the richest duck in the world.

Scrooge, the Manager and MacQuack go by airplane to explore but they are attacked by light swords. Meanwhile, Webby loses herself in the jungle and sleeps on the woods.The next day, Webby and some animals find an opal mine and discover that the Manager is responsible. The manager wants to buy Scrooge's ranch and become a rich man. Fortunately, Webby and the animals show who is the Manager and Scrooge preserves his ranch. Scrooge asked Webby when, how she made up to captured the bandit, she said &quot;group work&quot;.Master of the DjinniScrooge McDuck and Huey, Dewey and Louie go to the Sahara desert to find Aladdin's lamp. Flintheart Glomgold follows them. The ducks find the lamp's vault but Scrooge and Glomgold rub it at the same time. The djinni comes out and because he can't tell who rubbed the lamp first, he decides to have a race between Scrooge and Glomgold. By Scrooge's suggestion, the djinni decides live in Manor McDuck during the race. Once the djinni and the nephews go to the mansion, Scrooge fights Glomgold's tramps (like the villain trying to kill him with a rock avalanche). Scrooge decides to win the race to Glomgold leave his nephews without a dime.At McDuck's mansion, the djinni starts to like the luxuries of Scrooge's house (because he can eat burgers, swim in the pool and watch TV). He likes it so much that he decides to send Scrooge and Glomgold to back in time so he can live free forever. Because the two billionaires do not know about the time voyage, they continue running when they find a palace. The Sultan, thinking that they are spies of Hemir, decides to give them to crocodiles. But Schewebazade, the Sultan's young wife, saves them and they escape from the palace. The guards follow them and Glomgold go for his count. Meanwhile, the nephews and Webby, who witnessed the evil act of the djinni, put the djinni back in the lamp and let him leave only when he agrees to bring Scrooge back from the past.At this moment, Scrooge and Glomgold come back to the present-day. Unfortunately, Glomgold finds and explores and make over win the race. Obviously, Scrooge can make over come to Duckburg only to discover that Glomgold won the race. Glomgold's first wish is to send Scrooge to a desert island. Glomgold uses his second wish by mistake to go to the desert island with Scrooge (he said he wishes he could see the look on Scrooge's face face when he gets there). At the island, Glomgold wishes that the lamp was never found in the first place. This puts everything back in time to when the ducks open the vault entrance. The explosion made the lamp fall and despite the ducks can back to Duckburg alive, the lamp stays in the vault as never found.Sweet Duck of YouthOne night, Scrooge McDuck and Launchpad go back to Manor McDuck. When Scrooge enters the mansion, he discovers that it is his birthday (which is weird because the show depicts it as a summer night whereas Scrooge's real birthday is in the winter or very late fall) and his family prepared a surprise party. Scrooge is unhappy because he is old. When Mrs. Beakley mentions the fountain of youth, Scrooge runs to the library. There he finds a book that talks about &quot;Ponce de Loon&quot;, a Spanish explorer who said he found the fountain of youth in Florida.The next day, in Florida, the ducks are in a tropical forest when they meet an old man who is also trying to find the fountain of youth. After finding a map, the guys find the Fountain of Youth. However, they find out that the fountain only makes their reflection look youthful. Scrooge goes home and realizes that people have to age.Where No Duck Has Gone BeforeOne day, at Manor McDuck, Huey, Dewey and Louie are watching the television show &quot;Ducks of the Galaxies&quot; when Scrooge buys the Duckburg studios, the place where &quot;Ducks of the Galaxies&quot; is filmed. Scrooge tells Gyro to build a toy spaceship, but Gyro builds an real spaceship.The spaceship sends the Captain, Huey, Dewey, Louie, and McQuack to space where they are captured by aliens. The nephews find out that the Captain is evil. Eventually, Huey, Dewey, and Louie go back to Earth where Scrooge punishes the Captain. Back to the Klondike On Valentine's Day, Scrooge tells his nephews and Webby his only love story::When Scrooge worked at Once Upon a Dime|White Agony Creek he went to Blackjack Saloon where he met Goldie, a pretty singer. After Scrooge lost his gold nugget by Dangerous Dan, he bet that Goldie can't make honest money. Goldie and Scrooge work for many months to get a lot of gold.

He led the Irish Parliamentary Party. He played an important part in the fight for Home Rule for Ireland. Background Charles Stewart Parnell was born in Avondale, County Wicklow. His family was upper class. He was the seventh child of John Henry Parnell and his United States of America|American wife Delia Tudor Stewart. Parnell's great-grandmother was in the Tudor dynasty|Tudor family so he was related to the British Royal Family.;ref name&quot;Oxford;Bew, Paul: &quot;Parnell, Charles Stewart (1846-1891), politician and landowner&quot;. ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press .;His parents separated when he was six. He was sent to different schools in England, where he was unhappy. His father died in 1859 and he inherited his fortune. He then studied at Cambridge University (1865-9) but never graduated. He was Sheriff of his county, Wicklow, prior to being an MP (member of the House of Commons). Member of Parliament Charles Stewart Parnell was first elected to the British House of Commons|House of Commons, as a Home Rule League MP for Meath, on 21 April 1875. During his first year Parnell mostly stayed quiet and watched. He first drew attention in 1876 when he said a group of Irish rebels called Fenians (accused of killing a police officer) did not kill anyone. Home Rule Parnell fought for Ireland's right to be self-governing Home Rule Movement. At first he met with Fenians, but he later decided to work with Michael Davitt. He was elected president of Davitt's movement, (called the &quot;Land League&quot;) on 21 October 1879. After becoming the MP for Cork City, he formed a new group with ideas from many other groups called the Irish National League which later became the Irish Parliamentary Party. Although Ireland did not become independent for many years, Parnell's work in Parliament pushed Ireland much closer to their goal by unifying Irish politics. Personal life  Katherine O'Shea On 24 December 1889 Captain William O’Shea decided to divorce his wife Katherine O'Shea. O'Shea had already separated from his wife, but would not divorce her as she was expecting a substantial inheritance.O'Shea at last filed for divorce.;&quot;Filed for divorce&quot; means his lawyer presented an appeal for divorce with the court. It required &quot;grounds&quot;, that is legal reason(s) for the divorce.; He claimed she had an affair and three children with Parnell. Parnell did not reply to the claim, and the divorce was granted. Because divorce is not allowed by Roman Catholicism|Catholics, many Catholics who supported Parnell did not like him anymore and he became less popular.Parnell married Katherine after her divorce. The damage from his affair caused many people to lose respect for him, and he became less powerful. Many members of his party left him. He died on 6 October 1891 of a heart attack and in the arms of his wife. He was 45 years old.

What technical data provided from the [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:CheckUser#Basic_interface checkuser interface] may assist a checkuser in separating the users?'''A:''' There are three parts to the checkuser interface; 1) Get IPs (obtains the IP addresses that a named user has used), 2) Get edits from IPs (obtains the edits that a particular IP address has performed), and 3) Get users (provides user names that have edited from a specific IP address). Using a combination of these three tools provides a checkuser with the ability to sort out who is abusing the wiki and who is not. Since many abusive editors have patterns to their editing, it should be possible to only target the right person. If in doubt, it'd be best to check with someone else who is a checkuser or perhaps even a steward. Since browser information is also available, it can be used to aid in separating users as most users probably only use a single OS and browser. This is not definitive however as some users do have multiple machines or use more than one browser. '''Q:'''In what two circumstances are you m:privacy policy|permitted to release an IP (or group of IPs) to an administrator?'''A:'''When the user has performed a lot of vandalism or very disruptive editing it is allowed to release the information to a third-party. This would include admins. Additionally in cases of investigation of abuse and it is also acceptable to release personally identifiable information when the safety of the WMF, its users or the public is at risk. Furthermore it can be released with the permission of the user in question and also when ordered to by a court order or a subpoena. However, it would not normally be needed to actually release the private information of a user. Most often it would be only required to say that the checkuser has been confirmed as the same person, or that the user is from the location they say they are from. '''Q:'''Are you permitted to tell a user that you have checked them?'''A:'''The privacy policy states that when presented with a subpoena to release information to law enforcement or government agencies, that the user whom it is regarding will be contacted in order to inform them information has been requested. This also implies that users can be told they have been checked. Since checkuser requests are normally made on a publicly accessible page on wiki, and since the result (not the actual private info) of a request is then posted to that page, it seems obvious that users will be aware that they have been checked. '''Q:'''How many machines will a CIDR /16 block?'''A:'''CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) is the &quot;solution&quot; that was started to prevent the running out of IP addresses under IPV4 before IPV6 was implmented. It has (in some ways) trumped IPV6 (which very few people actually use). The /16 range block will block 65536 individual IP addresses. It may, however, block many more than that due to use of NAT *network address translation&quot;. But it's the most accurate answer I can give in general terms. '''Q:'''Will technical data always prove if an editor is sockpuppeting?'''A:'''No! There is no such thing as &quot;always&quot;. When ever anyone in life tells you that something will always happen, you can rest assured they it won't. The data will give you a good idea; often a very good idea. But you can rarely be totally sure. Sometimes it will be a judgment call. Sometimes a hard one, occasionally a wrong one (hopfully only rarely). This is why it is important to leave a blocked user able to edit their talk page, or able to email a sysop just in case a mistake was made.;Questions from User_talk:Chris G|;b;;font style&quot;color:Green;;Chris;/font;;/b;'''Q:''' How would you detect if an IP is an open proxy?'''A:'''I've not had much personal experience in dealing with open proxies, but I understand the basics. It is not always going to be possible to 100% determine if it is an open proxy, but one can often get a very good indication that it is by the following. Firstly, one should have a good reason to suspect that an open proxy exists. Such grounds for suspicion can include; that an IP is in fact running a web proxy, and that one of the following additional conditions are met; 1) the proxy permits access to anyone, 2) that it doesn't let anyone access it but that the level of authentication is very weak and easily bypassed, 3) that the details for accessing the proxy are to be found publicly on the Internet, 4) the host has been hijacked so as to allow one or more persons unauthorized access to it. Probable cause for thinking that an open proxy exists are; many edits from a single IP address, especially if they occur around the clock; inconsistent traffic coming from a single IP address or traffic of such a nature as to cause one to think that it is being used by multiple people; similar traffic originating from multiple IP address (esp if from all over the world) that lead one to believe that a single person is using multiple IP addresses can lead one to believe that some of them may be open proxies; listing on sites that contain lists of openproxies or in completewhois reports. There are also multiple checker scripts and tools that can aid one in making the decision. Checking also to see if an IP has been blocked elsewhere on WMF (meta, enWP) as an open proxy can help too. My standard rule would still apply; if in doubt, check with someone who knows more than you, and if need by, err on the side of caution with a short block and then a longer block if it turns out to be an open proxy. '''Q:''' What method do you use to calculate a range block? '''A:'''Generally I'd use a table of CIDR ranges as it is a very quick method and is less prone to error, but I do also have the knowledge to do the binary math if need be. I believe in as small a range block as is needed. I'd also check with the list of sensitive IP addresses and check what collateral blocks of named users I'd be affecting. If there is going to be collateral blocks, I'd consider using an anonymous only block or else giving the named users (if trusted) the flag &quot;IP block exempt&quot;. Again, check with someone else if unsure.Support# &amp;ndash;;strong;User:Juliancolton|;span style&quot;font-family:Script MT;color:#36648B;Juliancolton;/span;;/strong;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;User_talk:Juliancolton|;sup;;span style&quot;font-family:Verdana;color:gray;''Talk'';/span;;/sup; 04:24, 2 August 2009 (UTC)# support '''Super mega extreme support''', completely trust him. --User:S3CR3T|;font color#DE3163;;fontComic Sans MS;'''''S3C''''';/font;;/font;User talk:S3CR3T|;font colorpink;;small;'''''R3T''''';/font;;/small;;small; &amp;hearts;s you!;/small; 04:31, 2 August 2009 (UTC)# I believe Fr33kman is well qualified for this position, and fully trust him.

It is a comical, satirical love story. It was admired by people like Edmund Burke, Mary Wollstonecraft, and Choderlos de Laclos. Background ''Cecilia'' was published in July 1782. Frances Burney started work on it in 1780. Her father, Dr. Charles Burney and her mentor, Samuel Crisp stopped her from writing a play for the stage, to be titled ''The Witlings''. Frances Burney tried to change their minds, but Dr. Burney insisted she stop and continue writing the more ladylike novels instead. “In the Novel way, there is no danger,” he said.;Letter from Dr Charles Burney to Frances Burney, undated, p. 15; The stress of this made Burney sorrow|unhappy. Critics believe this may be why ''Cecilia'' is sadder than her first novel.PlotCecilia Beverley is a young wikt:heroine|heroine, who leaves her country home to travel to London. She will live with a guardian, Mr. Harrel. Cecelia is an wikt:orphan|orphan wikt:heiress|heiress. To inheritance|inherit her money, when she marries, her husband must take her surname and become &quot;Mr. Beverley&quot;. In London, she is wikt:invite|invited to a friend's house (Mr. Monckton), for breakfast, who has married for money. But he loves Cecilia and hopes to marry her when his wife dies. He is afraid Cecilia might fall in love with someone else. At his house she meets Mr. Morrice, a young lawyer; Captain Aresby and Mr. Belfield, who can’t seem to settle down. Mr. Monckton’s wife, Lady Margaret and her servant, Miss Bennet, are also there. Cecilia notices Albany, an old man sitting quietly in the corner, who behaves strangely. She also notices that Lady Margaret dislikes her.Mr. Harrel is married to Cecelia's childhood friend, Priscilla. So, Priscilla gives parties to introduce Cecelia to new friends: Sir Robert Floyer, Mrs. Harrel’s shy brother Mr. Arnott, Mr. Gosport, silly Miss Larolles; and proud, silent Miss Leeson. Mr. Monckton visits her and she greets him happily. At an opera, Cecelia sees Albany, the strange old man again. He shouts a warning that she is in danger from the people around her and that she should help the poor. The next morning, she sees a poor woman, Mrs. Hill, who comes to beg for her starving family. Mr. Harrel has refused to pay them. Cecilia tries to make him pay, but he will not. Finally, Mr. Arnott, feeling sorry for the Hills, lends him the money to pay them. Cecilia, shocked at how mean Mr. Harrel is, wants to go stay with another guardian. But, they seem just as bad. While Mr. Harrel spends and gambling|gambles his money; Mr. Briggs is a selfish miser and Mr. Delvile is a wikt:vain|vain man.Mrs. Harrel has a masquerade ball. Mr. Monckton is in disguise as a black demon and fights anyone who comes near Cecelia.. A person dressed like a white dominoes|domino tries to help her, as do Mr. Arnott, Mr. Gosport, and Mr. Belfield. Cecilia is surprised at how well the domino knows the faults of her guardians. She wonders who he could be. Later, Cecelia goes to the opera again with Mrs. Harrel. There, she meets Mr. Belfield, who is courteous; but Sir Floyer acts rudely. The two men get angry and have an argument that leads to a duel. Afraid, Cecilia hurries to her house, and worries over the duel.The next morning, Cecelia is told that Mr. Belfield is a little injured, but Sir Floyer is well. Cecilia finds out that the white domino she saw at the masquerade party is Mortimer, Mr. Delvile’s son. Soon after, she meets Mrs. Delvile, who she likes. Now she wants to stay with them, instead of with the Harrels. But, she discovers that Mortimer thinks that she is in love with Mr. Belfield. Or perhaps, that she is engaged to Sir Floyer, who has asked her to marry him. Even though she has refused him, Mr. Harrel tells everyone they will be married soon. Later, she meets Mr. Albany again, who introduces her to Belfield's sister, Henrietta, and asks Cecilia to help her. Cecilia finds out that Mr. Belfield’s wound is serious, but because he does not have enough money he could not call a doctor. She helps the Belfields, begins a friendship with Henrietta, and finds out that Mortimer Delvile, too, is helping them. Disgusted with Sir Floyer’s rudeness and the Harrels’ silliness, she stays for a while with Mrs. Delvile, whom she has become fond of, and Mortimer. But, Mr. Monckton tells lies about them because he sees Cecelia likes them. But Cecilia does not believe him, and she realizes that she is in love with Mortimer, who still thinks she is engaged to Sir Floyer.Mr. Harrel threatens her with his own suicide, so Cecilia lends him money for his debts. Mr. Delvile is suddenly called away, and Mortimer is happy and surprised to find out that Cecelia loves him. But, when she meets him again she is hurt by his coldness to her. Mr. Harrel loses more money by gambling and his violent behavior to his wife frightens Cecilia. After drinking, he suddenly kisses his wife and shoots himself. Terrified and upset, Cecilia meets Mortimer, who forgets to be cold. He travels with her and Mrs. Harrel to Delvile Castle, where Cecilia finds Mortimer’s behavior confusing, and Mrs. Delvile makes it clear that she does not want Cecilia to marry her son. Lady Honoria, a relative of Mrs. Delvile’s, comes and teases her about Mortimer. At last, Mortimer says that he cannot marry her, because he would have to change his name from Delvile to Beverley. He is too sad to see her anymore and he leaves the country. Cecilia says goodbye to him coolly. Mrs. Delvile, instead of going to see her son, goes to her family friend, Mrs. Charlton, and stays with her instead. While there, Mr. Biddulph, a friend of Mortimer's, sees with surprise that she is embarrassed whenever he talks about his friend, and tells that to Mortimer in a letter. Confused, Mortimer decides to find out for himself. Lady Honoria steals Mortimer’s dog, Fidel, and gives it to Cecilia to tease her. One day, Cecilia, patting the dog, talks to him about her love for Mortimer, and how much she misses him – and looking up, sees—Mortimer!Amazed that she loves him, he asks her to marry him. Cecelia is confused, and cannot hide how much she loves him; but she is angry when he suggests that they marry in secret. He explains that his parents will never allow their marriage. So, even though Cecilia is afraid and feels guilty, she says yes. She innocently tells Mr. Monckton about her plans. He becomes furious and tries his best to break them up. During the wedding, he sends Miss Bennet, Lady Margaret’s servant, and his helper, to interrupt it. Mrs. Delvile, hearing of it, comes and tells Cecilia that what Mortimer says is true – she will never let them marry. Cecilia is unhappy, but she loves Mrs. Delvile too much to make her hate her, and finally agrees that she will not marry Mortimer. but he insists on seeing her again. Because of this, all three came together for a last meeting. Mortimer begs Cecilia to be his wife, and says he doesn’t care if he is Mr. Beverley or not. Mrs. Delvile, horrified, suddenly falls very sick. Both Mortimer and Cecilia are frightened, so they decide to do as she says, and never meet again. Mrs. Delvile, after kissing Cecilia goodbye, leaves as soon as she is better. The next day Mrs. Charlton suddenly dies. These events cause Cecelia to be sad and lonely, so she leaves for London. Because she is now old enough to have her fortune, she buys a quiet house in her neighborhood and lives there with Henrietta Belfield. Mortimer suddenly visits them. Cecelia finds out that Mrs. Delvile has said that if she will give up her fortune, so Mortimer will not be Mr. Beverley, but Mr. Delvile, she can marry her son. Mortimer happily says that they can marry with just her personal fortune. Cecilia, horrified, tells him that she has none of her personal fortune left. She has lent most of it to Mr. Harrel, and used the rest for other things, such as helping the Hills. Cecilia also finds out that somebody has told this to Mr. Delvile already, but with lots of lies. She begins to suspect Mr. Monckton. Mrs. Delvile says yes and Cecilia and Mortimer marry quietly and happily.Later, Mrs. Matt, one of the poor people she has helped, tells her who stopped her first wedding—Miss Bennet! Cecilia decides that the person who sent her must have been Mr. Monckton. She also realizes that he, too, must have been the one who lied so bitterly about her to Mr. Delvile. Shortly after, a servant comes and tells her that Mr. Monckton is dead. Soon after, Mortimer comes and says he too had found out Mr. Monckton’s meanness, and he had angrily told Mr. Monckton to tell Mr. Delvile the truth about Cecilia. Mr. Monckton angrily said no, and they shot each other in a furious fight. Mortimer was safe, but Mr. Monckton was badly hurt. Cecilia tells him to leave England with his mother before she can hear about the fight, and agreeing, he goes. However, her marriage has been discovered, so her fortune is taken away from her while Mortimer is gone. Now unable to live in the house she bought, she tells Henrietta to live with Mrs. Harrel and Mr. Arnott while she looks for Mortimer. Cecelia goes to Mr. Belfield to ask for help; but while there, Mortimer suddenly walks into the room and sees them together.Angry, surprised, and jealous, he leaves. Cecilia starts to become crazy. She tries to go to Mr. Delvile for help, but he proudly refuses to see her. At last, some people, thinking she has escaped from a hospital for crazy people, lock her up in a room and write in a newspaper about her. Albany recognizes her, and calls Mortimer to come quickly. Henrietta, too, reads the newspaper, recognizes her, and hurries to see her. Mortimer sees her and quickly calls his old friend, Dr Lyster, to heal Cecilia. Even though she grows crazier while in a fever, she finally gets well. She and Mortimer forgive each other and explain what really happened. Mr. Delvile, feeling guilty when he hears that Cecilia almost died, finally lets her and Mortimer come to his house and see him again. In the end, they live happily together. Mrs. Delvile’s sister gives Cecilia a lot of money when she dies. Cecilia can begin helping the poor again with Albany, who is happy that she did not die. Mrs. Harrel marries again, and soon begins to have parties and friends again. Mr. Arnott and Henrietta marry.

'Oh! It is only a novel!' replies the young lady, while she lays down her book with affected indifference, or momentary shame. 'It is only ''Cecilia'', or ''Camilla'', or ''Belinda'''; or, in short, only some work in which the greatest powers of the mind are displayed, in which the most thorough (complete) knowledge of human nature, the happiest delineation of its varieties, the liveliest effusions of wit and humour, are conveyed (shown) to the world in the best–chosen language.&quot;The title of Austen's ''Pride and Prejudice'' is probably from Dr Lyster’s speech at the end of ''Cecilia'': “remember: if to pride and prejudice you owe your miseries, so wonderfully is good and evil balanced, that to pride and prejudice you will also owe their termination.”;Writing Pride and Prejudice, available online: [http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/pride-and-prejudice/biography/pride-and-prejudice-biography-finished].

I do this because I think it needs to be done.In my opinion we should delete all these pages from this wiki. They are basically unreadable by our target audience, and likely to damage us. It has become clear that the pages are unsimplified (or almost unsimplified) copies of very technical enWP articles. Most of the chemistry is at graduate level, or advance undergraduate level, which is an issue worth considering.More important is that the user who brought the material over has not, and maybe cannot, simplify the contents adequately. Apparently, he tries, but may not know enough chemistry, and does not have the editing skills at present to simplify them. I would say, informally, one would need to be a pretty experienced chemistry professor to simplify concepts at this level. Because the simplification cannot be done quickly, if at all, the pages should not sit there as they are. It is asking for trouble. Pages like these are a hostage to fortune: we could find extracts used by unfriendly persons against us.It would always be possible for an editor to re-introduce any of these topics in a manner which satisfies our rules.User:Macdonald-ross|Macdonald-ross (User talk:Macdonald-ross|talk) 07:36, 1 August 2011 (UTC)col-begincol-break*Molecular orbital ‎*Stereochemistry *Molecular symmetry *Electrocyclic reaction *Mechanical stress *Continuum mechanics *Pericyclic reaction col-break*Cycloaddition *Cheletropic reaction *Sigmatropic reaction *Group transfer reaction *Torquoselectivity *Dyotropic reaction *Theoretical chemistry col-break*Frontier orbital *Substituent *Diene *Conjugated system *Woodward's rulescol-end:I very reluctantly '''agree''', except for Diels–Alder reaction. Racepacket is not the only editor with an interest in simplifying that one. Peterdownunder has taken an interest as well. Let's leave something to work with. If that becomes simple, then other articles can be recreated. If not, we'll have evidence to show that these were not appropriate. Also, it is worth noting that Continuum mechanics seems to not be one of Racepacket's.:::Diels-Alder reaction, at least the intro is worth keeping as it explains why the two scientists were awarded the Nobel Prize. This is probably a class of article that we need for all the Nobel Prizes. --User:Peterdownunder|Peterdownunder (User talk:Peterdownunder|talk) 11:27, 1 August 2011 (UTC)::::This is a fair point. I have edited the Diels–Alder reaction page down to the minimum necessary to support the Nobel Prize references, and removed it from the list of AfD. It is still fairly bad as the links go to other, even more incomprehensible pages. User:Macdonald-ross|Macdonald-ross (User talk:Macdonald-ross|talk) 12:35, 5 August 2011 (UTC):It is also worth noting that rather than fixing these, Racepacket has gone ahead and created yet another imported article from En, Lyonel Feininger. This one at least is simple. The editor did follow the letter of the ban by working through his user page, but not the intent. His other copied articles still need hours and hours of attention. User:Gotanda|Gotanda (User talk:Gotanda|talk) 10:28, 1 August 2011 (UTC)::I don't think that Ad hominem arguments are helpful. I have a degree in Chemistry. I worked on the Lyonel Feininger article as a part of the edit session at the Archives of American Art on Friday. They assigned the topic. I did not create Continuum mechanics, but deletion debates should be decided on their merits not the identity of the editors. These articles can be useful to high school chemistry students or to chemists that do not have English as their first language. If you look in the subject index of most organic chemistry survey course text books, you will find these topics. As shown on the talk page Talk:Diels–Alder reaction you will see a number of experiments that show that the &quot;readability index&quot; of an article goes up when I add parentheticals and restatements that explain the concepts in simple terms. The experiments also show that the index is biased against the polly syllable words used by chemists. I am willing to respond to deletion debates on the individual articles, but I can't find them. (For example, Frontier orbital is just a redirect page on both this Wikipedia and en:wikipedia.) Thanks, User:Racepacket|Racepacket (User talk:Racepacket|talk) 13:21, 1 August 2011 (UTC):::I don't think deleting these pages (or a subset) would be the answer. About the chemistry, I cannot help; all I can do is read the respective article at another wp, and then try to &quot;paraphrase&quot; the subject in understandable language. Articles like molecular orbital, and molecular symmetry are central, and IMO we should have them (in an understandable form). What I see though is the incremental approach: copy the whole article to the talk page, and then move back one section at time, and simplify. Given our audience, I think it is better to have a shorter article that laves out certain parts, but that is understandable, rather than a longer one, that includes them, but is more difficult to understand. Consequently, this would probably be the way forward. If we as a community cannot tackle these problems (for lack of knowledge), we might also try to convince some chem-savy editors from enwp. As an example, compare :en:Cauchy distribution to Cauchy distribution; Yes I know, we are comparing a 500-byte article to a 27kb one; but the idea should be quite apparent. To me, it is also clear that articles need time to grow. Simplifying an article is a lot of work, esp. if we envisage to stamp it with GA or VGA. :en:Poisson distribution vs. Poisson distribution is similar (30k vs. 2k). In short, simplifying complex subjects takes time, all we can do in the interim is make sure that what is there sums up the most important points, and is understandable by our target audience. Speaking of the Poisson distribution: Siméon Denis Poisson, an 18th century French physicist does not have an article yet...--User:Eptalon|Eptalon (User talk:Eptalon|talk) 14:07, 1 August 2011 (UTC)*'''Userfy:''' Now Racepacket is working under restrictions that force him to simplify articles he's written/copied in his userspace.

User:Racepacket|Racepacket (User talk:Racepacket|talk) 15:29, 1 August 2011 (UTC):Progress report: User:Barras and I are working through these, although input from others continues to be welcomed. Thanks, User:Racepacket|Racepacket (User talk:Racepacket|talk) 22:31, 6 August 2011 (UTC)::I believe that much has changed since User:Macdonald-ross|Macdonald-ross has made his mass nomination. Each article is very different from the others. May I suggest that we discuss and vote on them separately one-by-one? I know that everyone is working toward what is best for Wikipedia. Thanks, User:Racepacket|Racepacket (User talk:Racepacket|talk) 17:58, 7 August 2011 (UTC)::Per Racepacket, I'd also prefer a request for each page, although we are currently working on this stuff to make it simpler. -User:Barras|Barras (User talk:Barras|talk) 18:20, 7 August 2011 (UTC)::::19 different RfDs to manage all of these separately are not needed because they all share a common problem. Although there have been some changes, if these are not deleted, they should at least be userfied and any return to the namespace should be fairly cautious (not just one person ticking a box). For one example, look at Stereochemistry and my comments on the Talk:Stereochemistry|Talk page. Much of the intro is still complex (although Peterdownunder did fix the first two sentences). As the article goes on, it gets more complex. There is still a whole complex chunk taken direct from En. What seems to happen in these articles is that the first sentence of a section or paragraph may be changed, but the rest of it left as-is. Yes, Barras is trying to help Racepacket with simplification, and I think my comments have pointed out where articles need to be simpler, but all of these articles (except for Diels–Alder reaction) need a lot of work to really be simple. Aside form just word simplification and sentence by sentence simplification, many of them need a simpler structure and a simple explanation of the context in the introduction. I think most of Macdonald-ross' original concerns remain. User:Gotanda|Gotanda (User talk:Gotanda|talk) 22:52, 8 August 2011 (UTC):::::There is a wide spectrum of articles in this list. One is just a simple redirect: Frontier orbital. Another is just two sentences: Group transfer reaction. It is impossible to write a simpler article about Group transfer reactions than this one. In Molecular symmetry, we include a table of 30 point groups with example molecules for each group. The table presents an important aspect of the topic. By using a table (which does cover complex ideas), we avoid any problems regarding complexity of English.:::::I have compared theoretical chemistry against the articles covering the other branches of chemistry, and they are all at about the same level of complexity. None should be deleted.;P;The basic difference that was brought out in the dialog between Barras and Macdonald-ross is the intended audience for these articles. I doubt that any third grader will want to read about molecular orbitals, but high school students or chemists which do not have English as their first language will value these articles. If you compare each article line-by-line, you will see that it is different from the English Wikipedia version. Although the ideas are complex, the wording is simple. The articles should be kept. Thanks, User:Racepacket|Racepacket (User talk:Racepacket|talk) 03:02, 9 August 2011 (UTC)As a user interested in physics and chemistry (but not at an very advanced level) I understood the majority these articles fairly easily, even though they deal with complicated subjects. Just because the subject matter is complicated and your average person may not find it enjoyable/useful to persevere with them does not mean they should be deleted. Racepacket has done a very good job of using simple syntax (and vocabulary where technical terms are not needed) to explain complex subjects. Definite keep.

As she is campaigning, Angus tells her that to run for A.N.T. Rep, you have to participate in every school activity(including what the cheerleaders shoot out of their cannon, being the &quot;Jumbo bunny&quot; prize for whoever wins the knock the can other game at the school fair and being the mirror ball at prom), so Chyna tricks Olive into running too. They both tell everyone to vote for the other person. In the middle of the election, Olive is winning by a short gap. Cameron makes a speech while Chyna and Olive argue and everyone agrees with him. Lexi runs for school president and gets the title. Some how, Cameron is nominated for A.N.T. Rep and gets the title. He wonders and Lexi says that students under five feet automatically run for A.N.T. Rep when they're nominated. Chyna and Olive are relieved and they make friends.

Hello, I was wondering in what way people become notable by travelling on a ship, the Mayflower. Articles about passengers are being created, yet for people such as Humility Cooper, almost nothing is known (except that she seemed to have travelled on the Mayflower as a child, and later in life, returned to the Old World). Yes, there are records mentioning her name. I do however think that &quot;notability&quot; in our sense is probably different. Given the few things that are known about her, the interest in her is probably limited to academic sources (for example those that look at the conditions of women at that time). In other words: in my opinion, having a separate article about her is probably wrong. A similar case can probably be made about other passengers of the Mayflower. In short, I think that we should not have separate articles for most passengers. So far I have not nominated any articles for deletion as I think that this is more a discussion about what action make a person notable. Note that the Mayflower did not have any accident, the ship simply transported people to the New World (Plymouth Colony, iirc), and back. :en:Thomas Andrews (shipbuilder)|Thomas Andrews (enwp) was a shipbuilder that died when the RMS Titanic collided with the iceberg, he is generally described as a hero, helping others leave the ship. Is he notable? What about :en:Madeleine Astor|Madeleine Astor (enwp), who survived the accident, and died in 1940? Or :en:Millvina Dean|Milvina Dean (enwp), who died in 2009, and who was the youngest person aboard the Titanic? - In short, what makes a person notable? --User:Eptalon|Eptalon (User talk:Eptalon|talk) 13:03, 21 May 2013 (UTC):You ask good questions. To me, Humility Cooper, for example, is probably pretty borderline. :That said, do understand that in US history, ''Mayflower'' has a unique, almost iconic status as ships go. It was the first ship to bring European settlers to the colonies that became the New England states. Those colonists were the first who came over as refugees from religious persecution, which in the US was a historically and culturally important aspect of the entire European colonization process. The story of the Plymouth Colony's survival through their first winter, culminating in the &quot;first Thanksgiving&quot; is an iconic story that substantially all US children learn in school. (Whether they learn it with historical accuracy ... is another matter!) :So at some level US citizens see almost everything pertaining to the history of that voyage of ''Mayflower'' as noteworthy at a certain level. ''The noteworthiness comes from a combination of the ''Mayflower'' voyage itself and the subsequent founding and building of Plymouth Colony,'' but as a perhaps-sloppy shortcut we tend to think of it mainly in terms of ''Mayflower.''::In comparison, when you look at ''Titanic,'' a ''Titanic'' survivor (I think) would need at least something beyond pure presence on the ship to qualify. Astor (above) was certainly noteworthy in her own right, even if ''Titanic'' added to her fame. Andrews (above) was ''Titanic's'' naval architect, not just a passenger and hero. So he was inherently noteworthy, too. (It's at least arguable that even if ''Titanic'' had never existed, he would still have been noteworthy.)::With respect to Dean, it's more borderline. But the fact that she was the youngest passenger, and the last survivor, gives her a certain cachet, too. I'm not sure that she'd have been considered noteworthy if we were doing this 100 years from now, but I'm not sure we're wrong for including her now.:So I come to the conclusion that to be noteworthy, a passenger needs ''something'' besides mere presence on the ship. With ''Mayflower'' the critical difference is that all the passengers have something else: they have Plymouth Colony. :User:StevenJ81|StevenJ81 (User talk:StevenJ81|talk) 14:19, 21 May 2013 (UTC)::Hmmm... In terms of Humility Cooper I'd tend to say that she isn't notable. The ship is, and those on the ship collectively would be notable - for example the fact they collectively created the Mayflower Compact. Individually, I'd say no. Especially when almost nothing is known about her. I'd suggest merging all the passenger articles (of which there are some, but also many redlinks) into Mayflower passengers and possibly a list with the little info known about them? If individuals have notability for some other reason, such as John_Carver_(Mayflower_passenger)|John Carver who was the first Governor of Plymouth Colony they can have their own article... Basically; if they are notable as a group then they should have a group article, notable on their own, own article in this instance... ;small;user:kennedy|;font color&quot;#800000&quot; face&quot;lucida handwriting;Kennedy;/font;;/small; ;sup;(user_talk:kennedy|;font color&quot;#800000;talk;/font;) ;/sup; 14:23, 21 May 2013 (UTC):::I would like to thank Eptalon for notifying me of this discussion and allowing me to state my opinion here. I have to respectfully disagree with the editor who does not think her notable. You cannot &quot;lump&quot; these people together. They came from different places, different countries and for many different reasons.:::Humility Cooper, is, in my opinion, not only notable, but especially notable to Simple Wikipedia whose articles are mainly directed to readers who are young in age. She travelled as a one year old child and was the youngest of the passengers, except for one other who was born on the ship. She was orphaned in Europe and travelled with persons who were probably her aunt and uncle, The Tilley family. Unfortunately, she also was soon to lose them to the cold and sickness of the first winter that took so many who had been passengers on the ''Mayflower'' and was then placed with yet another family. Humility witnessed the first encounter with the Native American population and the Thanksgiving|First Thanksgiving and did not returned to Europe until late in her teens, probably at nineteen years of age.:::It is true that there is little information of Humility at this time, but more records are, even today, being gathered and discovered by professional researchers in Europe and the United States.:::I think the young readers would not only find her notable but also would benefit greatly to know of her story. It is a story of courage that would inspire many young readers. I would also add that I believe that all of the passengers were notable just for being a passenger on the historic and momentous voyage of the ''Mayflower'', its extremely dangerous voyage which few ordinary people especially children had experienced before 1620 and for their part in the discovery and the settlement of Plymouth Colony. Humility grew and prospered even while more than half of the passengers died.:::I would hope that we would treasure this young child's story and that of all ''Mayflower'' passengers and to know that more information is actively being gathered even now on Humility and all of the other ''Mayflower'' passengers. While to adults, Humility's story may seem short of facts, to child readers, I think there is much there, spoken and unspoken.User:MySweetMelissa|MySweetMelissa (User talk:MySweetMelissa|talk) 17:20, 21 May 2013 (UTC)::::We have to distinguish between who is an interesting person to know about, and what makes a worthwhile encyclopedia article. The way we do that on Wikipedia is through our Wikipedia:Notability (people)|notability guidelines. I would make the following points:::::*The reason Humility was on the ''Mayflower'' was that her guardians made the trip. They were the people who made the decision to go, not Humility. One of the notability guidelines specifically says that a person is not considered notable just because they have a relationship with someone who is notable.::::*Simple Wikipedia's articles are not mainly for young readers. They are for several classes of readers: children, yes, but also people whose first language is not English, and people with poor English skills. We do not cater to any one group over the others.::::*A person is not notable ''for Wikipedia purposes'' because of what might be discovered about them in the future.::::*Articles exist on Wikipedia based on the notability of their subject, not based on whether someone might benefit from having them there. A person is not notable because of what they experienced in their life. The passengers as a group may be notable ''for Wikipedia purposes'', certainly at least notable enough to be listed in the main article about the ship. Individuals might or might not, depending on their individual stories.::::*Wikipedia articles are, first and foremost, encyclopedia articles. They are not popular biographies or inspirational tales. Wikipedia articles deal with verifiable facts, not how much &quot;unspoken&quot; information there might be. In Humility's case, it is not a lack of facts, but a lack of notability ''according to our guidelines''.::::I am not saying that it is not worth knowing about Humility, or any other individual ''Mayflower'' passengers. I am saying that here we have specific criteria to determine who or what is notable enough for a separate article. Humility may not meet those criteria. --User:Auntof6|Auntof6 (User talk:Auntof6|talk) 06:12, 22 May 2013 (UTC)::::::I think we should revisit the basic point of notability - &quot;A person can be notable if he or she has received significant coverage in reliable secondary sources&quot;. I think all the Mayflower passengers have met that requirement. As it is an iconic historical event it is important that we give it full coverage. Also, as it is used in schools, then Wikipedia should be an accurate and informative source for students, and even more so for Simple English Wikipedia. In the specific case of Humility, until I read the article I knew nothing about her. But the article was simply written and well researched. --User:Peterdownunder|Peterdownunder (User talk:Peterdownunder|talk) 06:55, 22 May 2013 (UTC)The simplest answer &amp;ndash; on which decisions should be based &amp;ndash; is at the top of the guideline: ''A person is presumed to be notable if he or she has received ;u;significant coverage;/u; in reliable secondary sources that are independent of the subject'' (emphasis mine). This does not include trivial mentions in historical records. If the passenger has been written about extensively in multiple reliable sources, then they are notable enough to have an article. That's the guideline. It's not about whether they made an impact or did something else with their life. I don't know how much Humility Cooper features in the sources that have been provided. User:Osiris|Osiris (User talk:Osiris|talk) 06:50, 22 May 2013 (UTC):We have a list of Mayflower passengers. All we know about her as facts could be put in a short paragraph there, and linked by redirect. User:Macdonald-ross|Macdonald-ross (User talk:Macdonald-ross|talk) 07:10, 22 May 2013 (UTC)::I believe that ''Mayflower'' passengers meet WP:Notability standards because they are ''Mayflower'' passengers and all that infers to Americans, both spoken and unspoken. We see articles about persons that have done nothing notable except hold a title. While that might not be notable in some countries, it is in others and they are respected and considered notable for that reason. The WP:Notability requirement is somewhat subjective as to country but should, I believe, be respected by all countries.::While I admit there is very little known about Humility Cooper at this time, more information is being found about these early Americans all of the time. She did come over on the ''Mayflower'' and that makes her as notable as any other Mayflower passenger, in my opinion and the opinions of many others who have sustained her and other Mayflower passenger articles for years now on En-Wikipedia.::Yes, I am aware that Simple Wikipedia had slightly different goals, those to children, language challenged persons, persons to whom English is not their first language, and to others and I applaud that goal. I think Mayflower articles are appropriate for all of the persons to whom Simple Wikipedia is directed. ::I have seen many extremely complicated articles here which are near duplicates of those on EnWikipedia, unattributed and language nearly identical and have wondered to whom these articles are directed? Yet, because they pass the notability standards as interpreted by the administrators, I raise no objection.::I would think that since there is no space issue, and the ''Mayflower'' story being of such significant to both young readers and immigrants there would be no question that Humility Cooper could stay as a stand alone article and I respectfully request that she remain as such.

That being said, we need to keep in mind that this is an encyclopedia. We do not decide on keeping articles based on whether they are appropriate for our perceived audience. We have plenty of articles that are not appropriate for children. The fact that more information might be learned about someone is also not a consideration. In my opinion, the Mayflower passengers are not equally notable. The ones who had leadership roles are more notable. The ones who accomplished more later in life are more notable. Yes, our notability guidelines talk about being mentioned in publications. But if the mention is always in connection with someone else, such as a child's guardian, you have to ask how much of the notability really belongs to the child.:::As for the articles you see here that you think are questionable, question them! The administrators do not decide what meets notability guidelines, the whole community does. If you challenge something and consensus does not agree with you, you lose nothing.

If you go to [http://www.worldcat.org/search?qtworldcat_org_all&amp;qMayflower+Plymouth WorldCat], there are 1,239 books about the Mayflower. If you use [http://trove.nla.gov.au/result?qMayflower+Plymouth+Pilgrims Trove], there are an equally large number of sources. I think the sources are out there and notability is not derived from original documents proving they existed. --User:LauraHale|LauraHale (User talk:LauraHale|talk) 23:30, 25 May 2013 (UTC):::Those are books about the ship/the voyage, and most of them are secondary sources (of the 20th century). What I tried to say is: Take Humility Cooper, and leave out the &quot;boarding documents&quot; and &quot;church records&quot;. There will probably be few documents mentioning her, which were published until about 50 years after her death. She was baptized in London, in 1638 or 1639. Someone wrote in 1651 that she had died in England. It very much looks like this is all there is. Based on this record we decide that she deserves her own article here? -It looks like there were agreements signed in 1626/1627. People listed on those agreements are likely candidates for their own article.

I cannot imagine anyone not thinking any of the passengers as being notable. I also have personal knowledge that many of the immigrants that come to the US, both children and adults are extremely interested in the Mayflower and all of the early Americans and are anxious to read more about them.

User:MySweetMelissa|MySweetMelissa (User talk:MySweetMelissa|talk) 17:07, 26 May 2013 (UTC)odThose are all secondary sources. Which is exactly what you're ''supposed'' to be using when deciding notability. Why is anybody suggesting that ''primary'' sources or arbitrary criteria be used to determine whether a topic is notable? We already have a criteria. It's written at the top of WP:N. Surely, the only thing that's relevant here is whether the coverage ''in the sources'' listed on the article is enough to show notability. Not what the person did with their life. User:Osiris|Osiris (User talk:Osiris|talk) 17:15, 26 May 2013 (UTC):I also see several secondary sources (not none or just one) and I agree with those above who have pointed out that this does meet the notability criteria. Also, is there a time limit for an article to be developed here? Because if not why the rush to delete an article not yet three weeks old? I fully understand why some might find this article uninteresting but in fact the readers here are children and those learning English. So the articles by their very nature seem to fulfill two objectives; to be of interest to the readership and to be good practice for improving their language skills. I've taught children but have also taught those new to the English language and from that viewpoint this is a decent article. It serves the stated goals of Simple English Wikipedia and is an article that may still improve as other editors contribute. We develop our rules through consensus and I don't agree to applying them in the most rigid sense. All things considered I see no good reason the article should not stay. User:Rus793|Rus793 (User talk:Rus793|talk) 18:10, 26 May 2013 (UTC)::Looking at the policy on notability (significant coverage in reliable secondary sources that are independent of the subject), we have 3 things to determine, significant coverage, reliable secondary sources, independent of the subject. I doubt that anyone can honestly question the last two (hundreds of books writen by hundreds of authors and historians centuries after the subjects deaths). Only significant coverage is questionable. ''&quot;Significant coverage&quot; means that sources address the subject directly in detail''. This is where it gets tricky - ''in detail''. In much of the sources, the coverage of the &quot;not main&quot; individuals is not extensive. Not a lot is realy known about them. But for the most part, what is known about them is covered. This is not a case of them being mentioned in passing. All that is known, every detail, is often included. The lack of information still available to us should not be used to say something is not notable. This lack of information may certainly affect how we deal with the subject in other ways, but it should not affect if it is notable. Given the sheer number of secondary sources which provide most every known detail about these people, I feel notability is proven. ::Auntof6 stated above &quot;The reason Humility was on the Mayflower was that her guardians made the trip. They were the people who made the decision to go, not Humility. One of the notability guidelines specifically says that a person is not considered notable just because they have a relationship with someone who is notable.&quot; Aside from the fact that the notability here is not based on the events but on the coverage of them, it is not a question of notability being inherited. No, she did not chose to go, but Jon Benet Ramsey did not chose to be killed. ''Why'' she was a passenger does not matter, ''that'' she was one would be all that matters. Her choice (or lack of) in the situation is immaterial.::That all being said, I do agree, in part, with Eptalon. While there is no doubt to me that Humility is notable, I do not feel there is ample information of warrant her own article at this time. A page listing all of the passengers with the known information about them with links to full articles on those where enough information is known to warrant full articles would probably be a better way to handle this. A page similar to the various &quot;Characters of ;blah;&quot; pages would be best. People like Humility, while notable are merely bit players in the history of the events - they are minor characters of history. Character list pages handle the major and minor characters in a fashion where the information of most characters is available - pertinent info for all with just a summary for the major characters with a link to the rest of the information we have (the main article).::'''tl;dr''': Yep, they are notable, but not enough info available of many of them for separate articles. Merge into a &quot;character list&quot; style page. --;b;User:Creol|Creol;/b;;small;(User_talk:Creol|talk);/small; 13:01, 27 May 2013 (UTC):::The Simple English Wikipedia Notability guideline, under General Notability Guideline states: &quot;Significant coverage is more than trivial but may be less than exclusive&quot;. As for degrees of notability, they can't all be Charlemagne or other famous historical figures and I also don't see degrees of notability mentioned in the guideline. In the List of Mayflower passengers a link to her page is desirable but that list has hardly a sentence on those without articles of their own. Also, the point wasn't addressed why are we even discussing this on an article not three weeks old when this was brought up. What happened to letting the article develop and allow other editors to edit and add information? We don't know these are the only sources available on her so why the rush to judgement? Common sense should tell us this is a conversation for some time in the future after the article and others like it have been allowed time to develop. It's a good article and I definitely think it should stay. User:Rus793|Rus793 (User talk:Rus793|talk) 17:24, 29 May 2013 (UTC)Some of these characters don't deserve a separate article. The only stuff known about them is birth, baptismal, marriage, and death dates. Most lived the ordinary lives of settlers -- tilling the fields, eating, sleeping, praying, and making babies. This is not enough to merit a stand-alone article puffed up with speculation, 19th century oil pictures of the first Thanksgiving, and long paragraphs about the uncomfortable conditions on the Mayflower.

This stuff is of interest only to genel. and desc. of pilgrims who (for some baffling reason) need to know every itty-bitty detail about their illustrious ancestors.

Hello there,As I already announced on the admin noticeboard, I am in the process of developing a bot to archive/delete &quot;stale&quot; DYK nominations. This bot expects a given format, which was the format that the &quot;news items&quot; were level four headings, and that we had level three headings which are &quot;categories&quot; (such as Arts, and Nature). I would prefer to re-introduce that format: An empty section &quot;Arts&quot; might likely entice people to nominate an Arts-related hook, which would mean that in the end we have a &quot;more varied&quot; DYK. At the time of this writing, there are seven hooks I think. One could be classified as Math/Thech/Engineering-related, the others would be &quot;People&quot; hooks. I am stopping work on my bot, until we reach an agreement on the format. --User:Eptalon|Eptalon (User talk:Eptalon|talk) 18:10, 15 June 2013 (UTC):The categories made sense when there was a backlog. Now that DYK is back to more reasonable (and typical) numbers they are pointless; they were not particularly well defined, there is far too much overlap and the page looked a mess, imo at least. It certainly did not seem a useful way to proceed, but it did have a purpose when we had so many unreviewed nominations. I'm also not sure what point there is in making a bot to archive old nominations. Again, there are that few nominations that it seems a waste; DYK has survived for nearly 5 years on a manual basis, aside from the one recent backlog incident.

I see no need for them particularly when they will be largely empty. It's redundancy that just isn't needed here, and I don't buy that point about them inciting people to write about specific topics. People will stumble on DYK and write whatever they want to: an empty category isn't going to promote that, and all it does is make DYK seem stagnant when large numbers are empty. The only reason that we get mainly hooks about people are because those are the ones that people nominate: they don't have to (because most of the time people are just finding already sourced facts) but that is what is happening - with or without categories. If we want to promote a wider diversity, let's slap on a restriction that the user has to have written/contributed to the article they're nominating... although that will probably kill of DYK.

User:Osiris|Osiris (User talk:Osiris|talk) 02:32, 30 May 2013 (UTC)::Yes, I've commented elsewhere on how the USGS colours are better for screen use than the ICS colours. A blaze of vivid colours might be suitable for a wallchart, but it is not suitable for screen viewing. Many of the ICS colours obscure the print, and lower readability. It is irrelevant whether the system is American or not; we make decisions based on our perception of what improves our pages. ;br/;On a related point, I suggest that templates should usually be set up so they present to the reader in closed format. Both graphics and text should not interfere too much with the flow of test, which is the primary content of a page.

Hello, List of cities in Western Sahara is a listing of settlements, with their approximate location, the controlling county, and two population counts. There are problems though:*Most of the 30-odd settlements are red-links*In many cases, the population is not known*In the case of La Güera, the population of about 3.500 people is probably wrong; the city is basically a ghost town, home perhaps to a few fishermen. La Güera lies in the desert, the main problemwhich led to the city being abandoned is sand.Since the terrirory of western Sahara is split between three contorlling countries, and that there is a (probably low-intensity) conflict, getting accurate figures for anything outside the Moroccan-controlled part will porbably be impossible. Knowing this, the big question becomes what to do:*Try to find population number for the cities?*Remove all the entries where nothing is known except the city name?*Delete the &quot;List&quot;, if less than 5-6 cities are left?This posting is to start a discussion; I think this is better here, than in an RFD, because it does not suggest an outcome...--User:Eptalon|Eptalon (User talk:Eptalon|talk) 09:42, 22 June 2013 (UTC):Well, one could delete the list box, move the page to Towns in Western Sahara, and just put a list of those cities which are blue-linked plus any red-links which are notable.

These city states are at the same administrative level with the other Bundesländer (Baden-Würtemberg, Brandenburg, Hessen, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Niedersachsen, Nordrheinwestfalen, Rheinland-Pfalz, Saarland, Sachsen, Sachsen-Anhalt, Schleswig-Holstein, and Thüringen). And no, the capital of Brandenburg is Potsdam, not Berlin; that of Niedersachsen is Hannover, not Hamburg or Bremen; so the case where one city serves as capital for two entities does not exist, except for Berlin, which is also the capital of Germany. Then there are (Landkreise) and Kreisfreise Städte, a Kreisfreie Stadt is basically its own Landkreis; there are exceptions here: Hannover is such a Kreisfreie Stadt, but at the same time it is the capital (and part of) the &quot;Landkreis&quot; Region Hannover. To distinguish from a normal Landkreis, whose capital is not a kreisfreie Stadt, Region Hannover is called: &quot;Kommunalverband besonderer Art&quot; (this construct also exists for Saarbrücken (&quot;Regionalverband Saarbrücken&quot;) and Aachen (&quot;Städteregion Aachen&quot;)).

I've been adding some manually now and then, and I was wondering about this. I partly hope there is something automated, because it would be helpful. However, I partly hope there isn't, because there isn't a one-to-one match across Wikipedias. Whether there is or not, I'd like to mention the following for those who may not have thought about it. As I understand things regarding Wikidata's interwiki links:*Categories, templates, and pages in mainspace can be entered in the interwiki part of Wikidata. If you enter categories or templates, be sure to put &quot;Category:&quot; or &quot;Template:&quot; at the start of the page name. Otherwise, it might match a category or template to an article because Wikidata doesn't know the difference.*Interwiki matches in Wikidata are by content, not page name. This can be tricky for us, since our pages don't have to be named the same as on English Wikipedia and pages with the same name can be about different things. For example, :en:Field theory is a disambiguation page, but here Field theory is not, so those pages do not match even though they have the same name.*If a page is in Wikidata with interwikis, and that page is moved/renamed, Wikidata needs to be updated to show the new name.*Only complete matches should be entered in Wikidata. For example, if we have a page about a person who doesn't have their own page on other Wikipedias, that page doesn't match another Wikipedia's article about their family or some other group they're in.*Wikidata doesn't want interwiki links to sections like you might have seen in the past.*If you enter an interwiki link manually in Wikidata, look at what's in the edit box before you save. Wikidata likes to guess what article you're typing in, and sometimes it adds characters you haven't typed. Before you save your entry, make sure it says what you want.Just some thoughts. --User:Auntof6|Auntof6 (User talk:Auntof6|talk) 09:29, 4 June 2013 (UTC):Not really any bots doing it yet. I think because they are still pulling in interwiki links that are already on pages. From what I understand once that is done they will turn their attention to new pages. For now you need to go manually. -User:Djsasso|DJSasso (User talk:Djsasso|talk) 14:02, 4 June 2013 (UTC)::From my experience, there are bots that watch when pages are moved and update Wikidata accordingly.

Warren was 21 years old, convert|32|in|cm tall, and weighed convert|29|lb. Barnum billed her as &quot;The Queen of Beauty&quot;. Nutt developed an &quot;adolescent crush&quot; on her, but Nutt would be disappointed.sfn|Saxon|1989|pp208-209Barnum gave Lavinia a diamond and emerald ring. It did not fit her finger properly, so he told her to give the ring to Nutt as a token of her friendship. Nutt regarded the ring as a token of her love instead. He fell more in love with her than ever. Lavinia was uncomfortable with his attentions.

More information will turn up, I'm certain, but I believe there is enough information now to make a good article on Commodore Nutt. His story is heartening and tells me that those who may be perceived by some as disabled can make a productive life for him or herself and may even find great fame and fortune. I hope others will enjoy reading this article as much as I enjoyed writing it! I look forward to your comments and will respond at once. User:Oregonian2012|Oregonian2012 (User talk:Oregonian2012|talk) 23:58, 17 July 2013 (UTC):I'll have a good read of this tomorrow. Very good-looking article, as we've come to expect from Oregonian. References all look reliable with a single exception - [http://nutfieldgenealogy.blogspot.com.au/2011/06/commodore-nutt-lived-in-fame-but-died.html this one] needs replacing - unless Heather Rojo is considered a reliable source in this field, it's a personal webpage. Will comment further after I've had a proper read through. User:Osiris|Osiris (User talk:Osiris|talk) 11:35, 18 July 2013 (UTC)::I will say I really enjoyed reading the article! I didn't review links, but core content is very nice.::In my opinion, by the way, ''if you can't find a better source'' in place of Heather Rojo, I'd be ok with that one in the context of all the other high-quality sources here. It would probably interfere with VGA, but I don't think needs to interfere with GA.::Vocabulary-wise, I think you're in great shape. I'd only change two words. There isn't a link to ''bruited'' on ''simplewiki'' or ''simplewikt,'' and that's a pretty non-simple word. (I have a large vocabulary, and I had never really seen it in English before this, though I understood it from French.) And while &quot;Lilliputian Love Triangle&quot; is a charming heading, you can't really do that without a link on Lilliputian&amp;mdash;and we usually don't like links in headers. I'd defer to those more experienced than I on that question.::Sentence structure is not simple yet, however. I think we'd all go stir-crazy if we never used subordinate clauses here. But you still have a lot of them. There are a couple of editors/admins here who are good and fast at this, but I don't mind helping out myself (though probably not today).::Question for more experienced hands: A couple of pictures seem odd here. I appreciate wanting to illustrate concepts when possible. But the photo of Lincoln (especially) and the photo of the NYC Police Commissioners don't really have anything to do with Nutt's interactions with them. Are they relevant here?::Terrific start, Oregonian! User:StevenJ81|StevenJ81 (User talk:StevenJ81|talk) 12:03, 18 July 2013 (UTC)::Did a quick read and liked it.

Great job on the references, all look reliable. The only one thing I would mention is that there are quite a few quotations, however brief, with quite complex terms (I had to look up what &quot;drollery&quot; meant). There are several possible ways of dealing with these: you could rewrite them in your own, simpler words, while still attributing them as indirect quotes; or you could append a brief explanation of what they meant; or you could link the terms to Wiktionary. Whatever you do, they're short and used sparingly so it's not a deal-breaker for a good article as far as I'm concerned.

They are both the same and are referenced in a very short paragraph. You only need one at the end of the paragraph. * A careful reading of the article will reveal &quot;style&quot; shortcomings and confusions like this: &quot;Although in favor of freedom of the press, ''Mandela was important of much'' of the country's media.&quot; I don't get this. And here: &quot;As South Africa's first black President[16][17], Mandela became ...&quot;. Properly the citations belong after the punctuation. When I find time, I'll list others here.* I would like to see a Background sort of thing before I give this article the thumbs up. Mandela comes from a complex culture of African village life. This village life is not what one would find in Western village life. His father had four wives, for example. In the western world this would called &quot;polygamy&quot; and regarded with some questions and reservations. In western life, it may even be illegal. In African village life however this appears to be legal and a normal way of life. Some authorities have indicated this village culture affected his entire life. It is likely unfamiliar to many, many readers. He is a world figure. He may die soon. This article will be accessed by many, many people at his death, especially American school children who will probably be given assignments to write a paper on Mandela. I think it essential that this village culture be briefly explained in the article. It doesn't need to be exhaustive or lengthy, but it should give the reader a good sense of Mandela's &quot;roots&quot;. There are many biographies of Mandela available in public and academic libraries and on Google Books. Mandela has written at least two autobiographies. I am surprised that these materials have not be referenced in creating this article. This article must be exemplary because Mandela is going to die and many children will be accessing this article.

I have been slowly working on simplifying the article on Simple English Wikipedia. I made the sentences less complex. I tried to use simpler language. (I think I did this well, but if not, please make suggestions for improvement. Simplifying some complex ideas is difficult.) For some of the specialized ski words, I created stub articles that explained more about a topic so there would not be so many red links. The article is fully sourced. It covers the topic comprehensively. I think it is an important article to work on with the 2014 Winter Paralympics coming up. I think it should be a GA because of the things I talked about. User:LauraHale|LauraHale (User talk:LauraHale|talk) 21:13, 12 September 2013 (UTC)First scan: * In simplifying the article, it has become almost incomprehensible in some places. This, for example: &quot;Para-alpine skiing is an adjustment of alpine skiing ''for with'' a disability, a condition of being unable.&quot; And this: &quot;With ''a upright'' drop of 300 metres (980 ft) to 400 metres (1,300 ft), this is one of ''the more need to be very correct when turning'' the para-alpine disciplines&quot;. And this: &quot;A factoring system ''was made come into existence'' for para-alpine skiing.&quot; Some sentences are too long for Simple like this: &quot;In this type, skiers going over snow quickly between alternating red and blue gates that are 25 metres (82 ft) apart, with men needing to go between 35 gates and women needing to go between 30 gates.&quot; Also there is an abundance of red links. User:Oregonian2012|Oregonian2012 (User talk:Oregonian2012|talk) 01:06, 14 September 2013 (UTC)** I think I have addressed all the grammatical errors and simplification issues you have mentioned. On the issue of redlinks, the remaining ones are all about proper nouns. I have included them for two reasons: 1) I want to know what articles I should be working on creating, 2) I think they would be useful articles to have to allow people to know more about disability sport but are not fundamental to understanding, from a Simple English point of view, the article topic.--User:LauraHale|LauraHale (User talk:LauraHale|talk) 06:01, 14 September 2013 (UTC)*I am also seeing some very awkward phrases. For example, in the section on classification, some of the descriptions in the tables either don't make sense or are poorly worded. Sometimes we have to use words that might not be on the various lists of Basic English words. For example, &quot;elbow&quot; is much simpler than &quot;angle of arm&quot;, and most readers will know what that is even if the word isn't on any of the lists. Take a look at the change I just made for more examples. I will look at more of the article when I get a chance. --User:Auntof6|Auntof6 (User talk:Auntof6|talk) 02:25, 14 September 2013 (UTC)**Further thoughts: one way to simplify a long article is to leave out parts that don't contribute as much to understanding the subject. For example, the section on &quot;types of skiing&quot; seems to have a lot of general information that isn't specific to the &quot;para&quot; aspects of the sport. To me, that could be trimmed. (I think it could be trimmed in the English article, too.) --User:Auntof6|Auntof6 (User talk:Auntof6|talk) 21:42, 14 September 2013 (UTC)*** I had thought possibly that there might be a good case for putting some of that information into separate articles: creating a new article about downhill skiing, slalom skiing, giant slalom skiing, etc. Some of the information applies to alpine skiing in general. (Though not always. They adapt courses for people with disabilities. There have been cases where sit-skiers have done test runs down a competition course and broke their backs because the landing was so hard. The same course has no problems for able-bodied skiers. ) If the issues are too many, I would be okay with withdrawing the nomination. I had thought I had done a much better job at simplifying and fault would be mine. I still obviously need work at simplifying and will continue to work towards that. --User:LauraHale|LauraHale (User talk:LauraHale|talk) 10:13, 15 September 2013 (UTC)****We already have an overall article on alpine skiing. You could just refer to that one, either with a &quot;main article&quot; tag or by creating separate redirects.;br/;I'm trying to think of how to help you learn to do this kind of simplifying, other than by critiquing what you do. I could point you to articles I simplified from enwiki, or I could re-simplify part of this article. I'm not saying my work is perfect, either, but it would give you examples. Let me know. --User:Auntof6|Auntof6 (User talk:Auntof6|talk) 14:09, 15 September 2013 (UTC)*Continuation of my comment on Simple Talk::However, I ran it through the other software, and got a much lower score: 52.6 on the Flesch scale, and grade level 10.4, years of formal education 11.7. Then I read some more of the text. Overall, I think the prose is rather clunky. On that alone I would say the article is not GA. One way to proceed is to use the first formula on my page, and go through the sentences it suggests you revise. Another way is to get a few young persons of secondary school age to read through it &amp; underline things that are not clear. Although it's just a personal opinion, I think (like many pages brought over from En wiki) that it is rather too detailed and complicated for our readership. A more ruthless weeding would improve it.

We don't have an opera in the VGA archives and I am willing to work on this article to get it there. Because we don't have an article in the VGA archives, I don't have a model. Nor do other editors. IMHO, we need some classic operas and ballets in the VGA archives to serve as models for other editors and in the rotation on the Main Page. I need suggestions for improvement. The '''Flesch Reading Ease is 62.08 and the Flesch Kincaid Grade level 7.01'''. I don't think the article at Simple needs long lists of aria and ensemble titles in Italian. Do you? Actually I think the article grades high because of the polysyllabic Italian words in the article. However, I can't see ridding the article of the few that are there. At Simple, the Italian should be kept to the essential minimum to maintain the Reading Ease. I'm not sure our readers need an &quot;Orchestration&quot; section though both paper encyclopedias and enwiki have this sort of section. But these encyclopedias are not written at an 8th grade level either. I'm not sure those reading at an 8th grade level need such as section. The orchestra in most operas and ballets are the standard orchestra of the day: strings, winds, brass, and percussion. This is why I need your help.

Anyway, I fixed a couple of small things. You linked &quot;interference&quot;, but that article is about a specific scientific meaning of the word, not the meaning the article needed. (You really have to watch for words that have more than one meaning -- there are so many of them in English, and even words that are listed on the Basic English lists are only basic for some of their meanings.)

There are a lot of compound sentences. (If you don't understand what a compound sentence is, just ask -- I won't think badly of you!) Some of the easy ones to identify are where there are two sentences joined with semicolons, and some where they're joined by dashes. However, there are more besides those. Here's an example::::::::Reagan's favorite acting role was as a double amputee in 1942's Kings Row, in which he recites the line, &quot;Where's the rest of me?&quot;, later used as the title of his 1965 autobiography.::::::That sentence should be divided into at least three shorter ones.:::::: I also see some places that need copy editing. For example, &quot;Although he used to be a Democrat who strongly supported the New Deal and admired Franklin Roosevelt.&quot; isn't a complete sentence. There are places that have some words that could be removed (in &quot;They both became good friends&quot;, the word &quot;both&quot; is redundant). There are some misplaced modifiers. There is a link to the dab page Debut, which should probably be changed to a simpler word anyway.

I think that makes it rather bland. I would agree that it's difficult to summarise his politics, but without question it's an issue a reader would expect to see in the intro. Both Reagan and Margaret Thatcher had rather similar liberal-conservative economic policies, perhaps influenced by such as Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman. Anyway, his economic policy was a change from that of previous administrations.

Also, quotes should not be used as a way to avoid simplifying. The important thing is that people with limited English skills are able to understand the article. If quotes with complex wording are used, the complex language should be linked or explained somehow. --User:Auntof6|Auntof6 (User talk:Auntof6|talk) 03:01, 21 November 2014 (UTC)::: I've explained the quote in simple English before the quote is given.
