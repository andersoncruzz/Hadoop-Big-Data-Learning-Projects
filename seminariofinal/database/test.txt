pos@ pos neg jonathan demme's _beloved_ , based on the book toni morrison , is a study in skillful literary adaptation .  on the one hand , the film manages to recreate key moments from the novel , evoking morrison's pragmatic narrative style without using her authorial voice .  on the other hand , beloved omits the some of the finer details of the book , favoring an ambiguously defined back story upon which to build the story's main events .  this choice is a smartly made one , for it creates an open space in which the story's wide range of emotions can gestate and grow .  indeed , the impact of the film is so protracted that much of it cannot be felt until long after the end credits have rolled .  _beloved_ takes place in the second half of the 19th century , during the so-called reconstruction era after the civil war .  for newly-freed slaves , it is a time of confusion and turmoil .  oprah winfrey is sethe , a slave who escaped a kentucky plantation and took her children to an ohio farmhouse , where she hoped the terror would end .  what she did not know was that it would follow her there , and remain with her long after the physical threat had vanished .  _beloved_ ultimately tells the story of sethe's search for forgiveness , one long-hampered by an unforgettable sin .  the film starts off on a dreary day ten years after sethe's escape , as a violent , unseen energy rocks her dilapidated farmhouse .  invisible hands terrorize her family , flinging objects across rooms , shaking tables , rattling floorboards .  sethe's sons run away , perhaps for good , leaving sethe and her daughter denver to fend for themselves .  demme's matter-of-fact handling of this supernatural element is just one of _beloved_'s intriguing aspects .  all of the characters take for granted that ghosts are real .  when paul d ( danny glover ) -- a former slave who escaped kentucky along with sethe -- arrives at the house eight years later and is confronted with the ghost's hellish visions , he doesn't run in terror .  instead , he asks who the ghost is .  as in morrison's novel , demme quickly establishes that the horror of the story will not come from the fact of the ghost itself , but from the terrifying past in which the ghost was created .  sethe is the one being haunted , but the ghost in the house is the least of her fears .  in fact , the ghost is one of the reasons she chooses to stay .  the story takes an bizarre turn with the appearance of beloved ( thandie newton ) , a young black-clad woman who appears on sethe's front lawn , leaned christ-like against a tree stump .  sethe and denver immediately take to the rasping woman and try to nurse her to health .  they know not who she is , but that doesn't matter .  only paul d is suspicious of the stranger .  little does the family know that beloved will bring about many changes , and force sethe to release a guilt she has held onto so urgently for eighteen years .  winfrey is arguably beloved's greatest asset .  she inhabits the role of sethe so convincingly it is hard to believe this is the same woman who shines brightly on a tv talk show .  lisa gay hamilton does an impressive job in the emotionally demanding role as the younger sethe , whose appalling actions make her the disturbed woman we see eighteen years later .  danny glover is affable as the sympathetic paul d , as is kimberly elise as denver , sethe's wanderlusting daughter .  as sethe's sage-like mother-in-law old baby suggs , beah richards authoritatively commands every scene in which she appears .  the film's least palatable choice of casting is unfortunately that of the role of beloved herself .  thandie newton plays the glassy-eyed girl with a demented fervor which is endearing at first , but which becomes off-putting and unintentionally laughable by the end .  departing from the honed aesthetic he used in such films as _the silence of the lambs_ and _melvin & howard_ , director demme has used a bit of dramatic overstatement to get across the vivid descriptions in morrison's novel .  totemic camera shots and color-saturated scenery are decidedly uncommon in demme's films , but the few he uses here work to the film's benefit .  _beloved_'s most memorable scenes are those of baby suggs' gatherings in a forest clearing , where the bright yellow-greens of nature entrance the viewer as much as suggs' words do .  for the most part , though , demme maintains his trademark directorial neutrality .  this , combined with morrison's equally frugal method of storytelling , may make _beloved_ somewhat of a challenge to watch , even to those familiar with the book .  though the film compliments the book extraordinarily well , it falls short in allowing the sort of accessibility one usually expects from a film .  nothing is spoon-fed to the viewer .  morrison's novel is just as enigmatic , but unlike a movie , a book can be put down to allow the various undercurrents and themes to churn and absorb .  the movie begins like _poltergeist_ , and ends like _the color purple_ , with shades of _the scarlet letter_ and _little women_ somewhere in the middle .  taken as a whole , beloved is a disquieting , one-of-a-kind experience , one to be viewed with guards down and spirits in abeyance .

" who are these jedi knights ? "  i asked .   " why are they churning out stale dialogue with machine-gun rapidity ? "   " why aren't these characters being developed before their adventures ? "   " why is there a special effects shot in nearly every frame of the entire film ? "  these were just some of my questions early on .  later , i asked , " where's the magic of the first three films ? "  and " why am i looking at my watch every fifteen minutes ? '  by the end of the film , i was tired , maddened , and depressed .  george lucas has funneled his own wonderful movies into a pointless , mindless , summer blockbuster .  the phantom menace is no star wars film .  take away the title and the jedi talk and the force , and you're left with what is easily one of the most vacuous special effects movies of all time .  it's an embarrassment .  i looked desperately for a scene in which a character is explored , or a new theme is examined , or a special effects shot isn't used .  there are a few of each , but they're all token attempts .  the fact is , george lucas has created what is simultaneously an abysmally bad excuse for a movie and a pretty good showcase for digital effects .  this is not what i wanted to see .  i didn't want to leave the phantom menace with a headache and a bitter taste in my mouth , but i did .  the story centers mostly around qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson , looking lost and confused ) and his apprentice , obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor , who scarcely has a line in the film ) and their attempts to liberate the people of the planet naboo .  naboo is the victim of a bureaucratic war with the trade federation ; their contact on naboo is queen amidala ( natalie portman ) , the teenage ruler who truly cares for her people .  after picking up jar jar binks ( a completely cgi character , voiced by ahmed best ) , they head to tatooine , where they meet young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) and his mother ( pernilla august ) .  qui-gon knows that the force is strong with young anakin , and so the jedi knights take the boy with them on their journeys .  the bad guys are darth maul and darth sidious , neither of whom have enough lines to register as characters .  there isn't anything particularly wrong with this story when looking at it in synopsis form .  the way lucas has handled it , however , it unsatisfactory .  first of all , we don't learn one single thing about qui-gon jinn .  not one thing .  what was his life like before this film ?  well , i imagine he didn't have one .  that's why he feels like a plot device .  this probably explains why neeson looks so hopeless in the role , and why he's recently retired from film ( i don't blame him , honestly ) .  obi-wan , a character i was really looking forward to learning more about , is even less interesting .  mcgregor has just a few lines , so anyone hoping to see the engaging young actor in a great performance is urged to look elsewhere .  since these two men are the focus of the phantom menace , lucas has served us a big emotional void as the centerpiece of his movie .  things start to pick up when our characters reach tatooine ; young anakin is perhaps the only truly fleshed-out character in the film , and lloyd does a thoughtful job with the role .  i was also hugely impressed with the sand speeder scene ; rarely is an action sequence so fast and so exciting .  and when anakin says goodbye to his mother , i found it moving .  also fairly good is portman , and she manages to give a little depth to a character where no depth has been written .  jar jar binks is one of the most annoying characters i've ever had to endure , but he's more interesting than most of the humans .  as soon as the relatively-brief segment on tatooine is over , it's back to the mind-numbing special effects and depthless action scenes .  i've seen many movies that qualify as " special effects extravaganzas , " but the phantom menace is the first one i've seen that had me sick of the special effects fifteen minutes into the movie .  the reason is obvious : george lucas has no restraint .  i can't say that i didn't find the effects original , because i did -- the final battle between darth maul , obi-wan , and qui-gon is visually exceptional , as is most of the film .  but i also found the effects deadening and tiresome .  my breaking point was near the end of the picture , as anakin is getting questioned by yoda and the other jedi masters ; in the background , we see hundreds of digital spaceships flying around through a digital sky , and i wanted that to go away .  can't we have one stinking scene that isn't bursting at the seems with a special effects shot ?  i got so sick of looking at the cgi characters and spaceships and planets and backgrounds that i really just wanted to go outside and look at a physical landscape for a few hours .  and then there's the question of magic .  what was lost in the sixteen years between the phantom menace and return of the jedi ?  i have a feeling that lucas was so focused on how his movie looked that he forgot entirely the way it should feel .  john williams' familiar score is no help , nor is lucas' direction .  i think it comes right down to characters : there are none here .  i longed for the magnetic presence of han , luke , and leia , but i got no such thing .  and what about the ridiculous expectations ?  mine weren't that high ; i simply wanted a film that showed me the roots of the films that i grew up loving , a story that had a few characters and a few great special effects .  instead , i got two hours and fifteen minutes of a lifeless and imaginative computer graphics show .  i don't hate the phantom menace as much as i resent it : i'd like to forget that it exists , and yet i can't .  it's here to stay .  i can only hope that episodes ii and iii have something of substance in them , because if they don't , then lucas will have pulled off the impossible task of destroying his own indestructible series . 
pos@ pos neg  " living out loud , " is the type of motion picture we don't often see : it is a film about mature , intelligent adults , instead of the usual american film , in which children basically dress up in grown-up clothing and parade around acting like immature seven-year-olds .  judith ( holly hunter ) , a fortysomething living in new york city , has been having a difficult time with life lately .  she is extremely depressed about her recent divorce to her husband ( martin donovan ) , who had been cheating on her .  she cannot sleep , haunted by terrible memories , often imagines off-the-wall things to try and make the world seem like a better place , and the only place she can really go to feel happy is to hear one of her favorite singers , liz bailey ( queen latifah ) , perform at a local club .  judith's life does start to brighten a little when , one night when she gets home to her apartment late , strikes up a conversation with the elevator operator , pat ( danny devito ) , a lonely man in his fifties whom has lost his daughter recently .  both of them create a sort of emotional connection with each other , seeking comfort with the other person , but while pat starts to form a deep love for her , judith only wants to remain friends .   " living out loud , " which was written by richard lagravenese ( " the bridges of madison county " ) , who is also making his directing debut here , is a wonderful film from beginning to end , one that is honest , genuinely funny , and poignant .  the three central characters , that of judith , pat , and liz , are all written to be free-thinking , complex human beings , and are all likable , but flawed , people who are constantly interesting , as is the film itself .  one highly original element of the film is that judith occasionally imagines things occuring in her mind in the way she wishes they would happen .  sometimes it results in comedy , and sometimes it turns out to be subtle and truly touching .  one sequence that stands out is when judith is at a restaurant by herself , reading a novel .  an older woman comes over to her , mentions that that is a great book she is reading , and then goes over to join her own friends .  as the woman sits down , she looks over to see judith by herself , and motions for her to come join them .  instantly , we realize this was simply in judith's mind , as we see the same woman just sit down at the table and begin talking to her friends .  holly hunter and danny devito both give the performances of their careers here .  hunter , of course , was brilliant in 1993's " the piano , " for which she won an academy award , but in this film she is even better , i think .  she finds the right note for each scene and holds it .  and devito has never had such a humanistic role before , which i was surprised about .  usually he is used as the butt of a joke , or as a caricature , but in this film , has a living-and-breathing , sympathetic person to play .  topping it all off is latifah , also a singer , who is quickly turning into a respectable actress herself , and has a juicy , natural supporting role as , in some ways , judith's role model .  another joy of the film is that it does not somehow form a contrived , " happy " ending , but , in staying with its realistic tone , manages to be upbeat , but truthful .  the last shot is an especially powerful image .  nothing is said , but just the image of someone walking down a sidewalk says it all .  the relationship that results between judith and pat is true-to-life and sincere .  as we watch these two people talk , and get to know each other , all that we wish for them both is to be happy , even if that does not include for them to become romantically involved .  and as , " living out loud , " which is one of the best films of the year , proves , sometimes a friendship is the strongest bond anyone could possibly ask for .

"  the good news ?  there's so much wacky humor culled from both fairy tales and popular culture that this movie should keep you in stitches .  we get our first inkling that we're in for a real treat as one of farquaad's men , intent on rounding up magical creatures offers 'five schillings for the possessed boy ! ' after observing dreamworks' rendition of disney's animated pinocchio .  meanwhile within the castle walls , a gingerbread man being tortured  by farquaad spits icing and yells 'eat me ! '  before breaking down and solemnly asking 'do you know the muffin man ? '  shrek , a green giant with bobbly antennae-like ears , is a grumpy recluse who really yearns to fit in ( although who could put up with his habit of making candles from his own ear wax ? ) .  donkey is a hyperactive , endearingly stunted creature who can talk and , therefore , believes will make a great misfit pairing with the uncooperative shrek .  donkey proves his worth sweet talking the princess-guarding dragon .  the princess proves to be more than a shade offbeat after learning she's not getting the fairy tale issue rescue she's been expecting .  when fiona's true colors are exposed ( including opportunies for some tomboyish gross out humor ) , a spark develops between her and shrek .  the script's details are gleefully impish , constantly poking fun at disney from the theme park world of farquaad's dulloc with its turnstyle entrance and 'it's a small world' parody of an information booth to the blue bird which meets a most un-disneyish fate after duetting with fiona 'snow white' style .  popular culture is represented with film references to " babe " and " charlies' angels " via " the matrix . "  myers chooses his 'so i married an axe murderer' scottish brogue for shrek in order to give his voice some heft .  while this may prove distracting for anyone familiar with that film , overall it works more than not .  eddie murphy steals the show as the fast-talking , motown-singing donkey , proving once again his talent as a vocal performer ( is it another wink at disney that donkey is paired with a dragon , a creature murphy portrayed in disney's 'mulan ? ' ) .  lithgow's a good choice for the supercilious , height-challenged villain lord farquaad .  diaz is energetic but ultimately nondescript voicing princess fiona .   ( a better choice would have been minnie driver , who's proven herself a terrific vocal talent in such diverse animations as disney's " tarzan , " " princess mononoke " and the " south park " movie . )  the computer animation looks terrific ( particularly donkey ) , although it won't elicit the types of oohs and aahs of pixar's work ( " toy story , " " a bug's life , " " toy story 2 " ) .  in keeping with its hip style , pop music is used , which like myer's voice may be initially jarring , but ultimately satisfies ( while surveying bridal candidates via a 'dating game' parody broadcast by snow white's evil queen's mirror , farquaad is told 'fiona likes pina coladas' - cue jimmy buffet ! ) .   " shrek " has good lessons for kids and humor targetted at every age group in the family .  while it may be derivative of the 1987's " the princess bride , " " shrek " addresses a new generation with similar sensibilities and doesn't suffer in the comparison .

pos@ pos neg capsule : this is a film that avoids easy answers .  wilhelm furtwangler , then the world's greatest orchestra conductor stayed in germany and cooperated with the nazis .  what were his views , was he a war criminal or a secret resistance fighter ?  how much did he know about crimes against humanity ?  the us government investigated him after the war and this film is a dramatization of that investigation .   , high +2 ( -4 to +4 )  in my opinion one of the best films of the last few years is istvan szabo's sunshine , a film that covers the fortunes of a jewish hungarian family under the reigns of three different regimes , hungarian aristocrats , nazis , and communists .  szabo's follow-up film , a german production , is much more limited in scope .  it is about the post-war investigation of who criminally supported the nazis and who opposed them .  ronald harwood's screenplay ambiguously looks at the investigation of a great classical music conductor who stayed on in germany when the nazis took power and became the most popular conductor of the third reich .  maj . steve arnold ( played by harvey keitel ) has been assigned by his superiors to investigate wilhelm furtwangler ( stellan skarsgard ) , perhaps europe's greatest classical music conductor .  when other artists fled germany , furtwangler remained behind and conducted for the hitler and his henchmen .  after the war is over arnold assigned to interview furtwangler and members of his orchestra and if appropriate to prosecute him for war crimes .  he secretly is told by his commanding officer to find furtwangler guilty .  from there we follow him and learn a little about arnold and something about furtwangler and his orchestra .  as he interviews members of the wartime orchestra arnold starts noticing odd peculiarities that may or may not point to a conspiracy against his investigation .  there is a certain sameness to the responses that he is getting .  perhaps any cooperation he is getting has been in some ways managed .  if so , perhaps he can never come to the truth .  in large part the film is about mind games that arnold uses to manipulate his interviewees and especially furtwangler .  where the script has problems is that in the end it is so ambiguous .  it has no obvious resolution and not much of a final act .  when it is over whether anything has been established is open to interpretation .  perhaps that is better than so many films that make it all to obvious what the audience should believe , but it is like watching a murder mystery and never finding out who the killer is .  we are given clues to something but they are never tied up .  in the end we just know more about both arnold and furtwangler .  the film is basically a stage play .  the visual is not very important .  corners are cut visually including touches like filling windows with photographs to avoid having to shoot on location .  as with a stage play , what this film centers on the dialog , and that is intriguing .  i rate the film an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high +2 on the -4 to +4 scale .  [there is one piece of sloppiness few people but me would notice .  at one point we clearly see arnold's desk calendar say " jan 16 tues . "  a quick mental calculation told me that combination could occur in 1945 and then not again until 1951 .  the events had to take place in 1946 or 1947 .  a possible date could be obtained from any world almanac . ] 
neg@ pos neg roger ebert asks in his review of sexy beast , " who would have guessed that the most savage mad-dog frothing gangster in recent movies would be played by . . .  ben kingsley ? "  my response would be that anyone who has seen alan arkin in wait until dark , henry fonda in once upon a time in the west , or anthony hopkins in the silence of the lambs should have guessed it .  they should know that the way for a film to create a really creepy sociopath is cast someone who generally plays mild , sympathetic , or even ineffectual character roles .  the same characteristics that make an actor seem gentle in most of his roles can work in his favor when a role calls for him to be fierce and vicious .  that is the principle that works for kingsley in sexy beast .  gary " gal " dove ( played by ray winstone ) has retired from a london career of crime and is living on a luxurious villa in spain .  life has become a routine of sunning himself and relaxing .  but his paradise is about to be shattered by a one-two-punch .  the first punch is a boulder that comes rolling down the hill next to the villa .  the second punch comes from gal's past .  back in london gang boss teddy bass ( ian mcshane , tv's lovejoy ) is planning to break into a safety deposit room in a bank and he wants gal .  he sends his most rabid henchman don logan ( ben kingsley ) to fetch gal .  don will accept any decision gal makes from " yes " to " certainly . "  however , if gal says " no " don will do whatever it takes to turn it into a yes including threatening guy's ex-porn- star wife deedee ( amanda redman ) .  in the meantime don knows just how to get under everybody's skin .  kingsley makes don a compact package of fury and nastiness .  there are some serious problems in louis mellis's and david scinto's script that should have been caught before filming .  when we see the actual crime we have no idea why gal was so important to its success .  beyond an ability to use skin-diving gear , no special talents are required of him .  any local hood could have done what gal is needed for .  additionally the crime involves digging from a swimming pool to the bank vault , flooding the vault .  no only could they have let the water out of the pool and avoided the complication altogether , but there is by far too much water to be accounted for by what was in the pool .  in spite of the provocative title , the story is cliched and overly familiar .  i know i have seen all the plot elements of sexy beast in old westerns like the law and jake wade .  the story is usually of the reformed outlaw , a robert taylor type , who has hung up his guns and is trying for a life of peaceful respectability .  the old gang , however , wants to do one more job with their old buddy and sends a rabid richard widmark type to go and git ? im .  it is not a great plot .  in sexy beast even the plot twists have gray beards .  perhaps the film has a little more respectability because it was made not as a western but as a stylish british gangster film .  it is an old plot dressed up to look new .  if the plot is old , at least the style is creative .  this is director jonathan glazer's first film , but he has reputedly done some notable tv ads for guinness stout .  his style does have some unexpected touches including some very odd dream sequences .  cinematographer ivan bird uses a lot of half lit scenes .  we see one side of a person's faces .  but the other side fades into the darkness , a sort of metaphor for the half-world these characters in-habit .  half of everything that is happening is also kept hidden .  us yanks will have a hard time with some of the dialog .  at least in my theater it was difficult to make out the words with the quiet speaking , the heavy accents , and the cockney language .  sexy beast is a very and familiar minor plot lent respectability in the us by being done in what is here a still somewhat novel genre , the london crime film .  the plot may be new to british crime films , but it would be overly familiar as a western .  further respectability comes from ben kingsley's high-powered performance .  i give it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . 
pos@ pos neg the heartbreak kid ( reviewed on aug . 26th/1998 )  starring charles grodin , cybill sheppard , eddie albert  in " the heartbreak kid " , charles grodin plays one of the most unbelievably obnoxious characters i've seen on screen in a long time .  he's a guy who spends virtually the entire running time of the movie bullshitting his way from one situation to another .  i doubt he ever expressed any genuine feeling at all during the film .  as the film opens , he has just gotten married , and is on the way to miami beach for his honeymoon .  halfway there , he begins to resent his bride .  by the time he arrives at his hotel and has met the cybill sheppard character , he is ready to divorce his wife .  as played by grodin , this character is the type of person that nothing will ever be good enough for him .  the phrase " the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence " was practically written with him in mind .  however , if he finds something he really wants , he will pursue it for as long as it takes .  the only problem is , once he has it , he immediately loses interest .  the end of " the heartbreak kid " is both hilarious and sad for that very reason .  charles grodin is at his smarmy best here , and sheppard is quite appealing as the object of grodin's desire .  however , the real scene stealer is jeannie berlin , daughter of director elaine may , as grodin's whiny bride .  she owns every scene that she's in , and makes you almost want to root for what the grodin character is trying to do .   " the heartbreak kid " was written by neil simon and it shows .  simon loves to deconstruct and analyze human relationships , and he's at the top of his game here .  as maddeningly obnoxious as the grodin character is , he's the type of guy that everyone knows .  the character of george costanza on " seinfeld " seems to have been modelled after him .  the only problem with the film is that it's not that funny , and it's billed as a comedy .  as much as i could see the realism in the characters , it would have been nice to have a chuckle here and there .   " the heartbreak kid " is not a date movie .  it has an extremely negative view of relationships , so seeing it with a girlfriend/boyfriend , could be hazardus to your health . 
neg@ pos neg  " the red violin " is a cold , sterile feature that leaves you uninvolved and detached .  it's a movie that seems almost clinical , as it traces the 300-plus-years history of the legendary musical instrument of the title .  opening in the 17th century , the story shows how violin-maker nicolo bussotti created the instrument as a gift for his unborn son .  but when tragedy strikes , the violin becomes the personification of its maker's grief .  from there the violin comes into the hands of an orphaned child prodigy at an austrian monastery .  again , tragedy strikes as the child is struck down at the moment of his triumph .  we follow the violin through the centuries as it finds a home in england and in mao's communist china before being discovered by expert charles morritz ( samuel l . jackson ) , who mounts a painstaking investigation to prove its authenticity .  the violin becomes morritz's obsession , just as it is for all those who converge on a montreal auction house to bid on it .  morritz , however , is the only one who knows the secret of the instrument and can understand and appreciate its creator's intention .   " the red violin " could have been a touching , inspirational story , as soaring as a beethoven symphony .  however director francois girard fails to make any emotional connection with the viewer .  here is a story that could have made use of various camera angles and lighting to heighten its impact .  girard , for some unknown reason , uses mostly master shots , keeping his camera - and thus us - at a distance .  we get no feel for the miracle that is the violin .  it's resonance , its purity of sound are not emphasized enough to make an impression .  nor are any of the performances memorable .  it's as if girard wanted all his actors to play second fiddle to his violin .   " the red violin " promises much , but delivers little .  it is dull at times , a bit pretentious and a might murky .  the movie's music soars over its story and performers .  and that is its only saving grace . 
pos@ pos neg usually when a blockbuster comes out , it's loaded with effects , stars , bad scripts , and plenty of action .  mystery men may contain an all-star cast , and efects , but the clever script and characters are what really works , which is rare to see this year .  the film is based upon the comic book series " the flaming carrot " by bob burden , in which 3 wanna be super heroes try and fight crime , only to be out done by the real hero of champion city , captain amazing ( greg kinnear ) .  things go a little haywire , when the sinister casanova frankenstein ( geoffrey rush ) is released into the city , where he captures captain amazing , and plans to wreak havoc upon champion city .  well , the trio decide to take matters in their own hands , by saving the city , but first they need some assitance .  this is where the film takes a turn for the better .  in the beggining , there were only 3 wanna be heroes .   " blue raja ( hank azaria ) , " mr . furious ( ben stiller ) and " the shoveller ( william h . macy ) .  sure they were enterataining , but their acts grew old fast .  that is until they aquire " invisible boy " ( kel mitchell ) , and " the bowler " ( janeane garafalo ) and " mr . splein " ( paul reubens ) , 2 of which rescue the film from becoming a disastorous mess .  thankfully , the original 3 heroes become amusing , with some support of reuben and garfalo on screen .  the whole premise is rather ridiculous , but packs a few punches to keep interest .  for one , the film is considerably clever .  it literally pokes fun at super hero films , like batman and robin , superman etc . in fact , many scenes are similar to batman and robin , including the opening sequence , only altered in a humorous and superior way .  a part of the cleverness comes from the cast .  sometimes a film with such talent is overblown , but the acting is what keeps it alive here .  while azaria and macy were enteratining , 2 characters really stood out .  one was paul reuben .  no matter how disgusting or revolting " mr . splein " may be , you still can't help but laugh .  it' so incredibly moronic , it's just a riot watching reuben relieve himself of bodily functions .  janeane garafalo also was an interesting character .  she seemed to be the most outgoing and convincing character on screem , due to her enthusiasm , that kept the film flowing .  men is worth seeing alone , for those 2 troubled heroes .  on the downside , a few of the heroes and especially the villain never really lift off .  kel mitchell and geoffrey rush , were both utterly useless .  their parts were so limited , they'd be lucky at all to be on screen for more than 20 minutes .  ben stiller too was wasted , mostly because of his unlikeable power and dialogue .  none of these characters get a rise out of anybody , but happily they are lost in the charming flow of the film .  as far as the budget goes , it was wisely spent on the cast , not the effects .  while the set designs and action all look nice , i'm glad there was a seperate aspect , that the film focused on , and for that i applaud .  slow at times , and rather pointless , mystery men still delivers .  it forgets about money making , because it's not likely to make a bundle like it's proceeders , and that's what works .  stupid ?  maybe , but for once i'm not disappointed .  no one expected an intelligent film , but you get a film thats wit captures your attention and makes you forget this miserable year . 
neg@ pos neg lengthy and lousy are two words to describe the boring drama the english patient .  great acting , music and cinematography were nice , but too many dull sub-plots and characters made the film hard to follow .  ralph fiennes ( strange days , schindler's list ) gives a gripping performance as count laszlo almasy , a victim of amnesia and horrible burns after world war ii in italy .  the story revolves around his past , in flashback form , making it even more confusing .  anyway , he is taken in by hana ( juliette binoche , the horseman on the roof ) , a boring war-torn nurse .  she was never really made into anything , until she met an indian towards the end , developing yet another sub-plot .  count almasy begins to remember what happened to him as it is explained by a stranger ( willem dafoe , basquiat ) .  his love ( kirstin scott thomas , mission impossible ) was severely injured in a plane crash , and eventually died in a cave .  he returned to find her dead and was heart-broken .  so he flew her dead body somewhere , but was shot down from the ground .  don't get the wrong idea , it may sound good and the trailer may be tempting , but good is the last thing this film is .  maybe if it were an hour less , it may have been tolerable , but 2 hours and 40 minutes of talking is too much to handle .  the only redeeming qualities about this film are the fine acting of fiennes and dafoe and the beautiful desert cinematography .  other than these , the english patient is full of worthless scenes of boredom and wastes entirely too much film .   , 
pos@ pos neg the ultimate match up between good and evil , " the untouchables " is an excellent movie because it looks deeper into an already examined rivalry .  based on the 1959 television show of the same title , " the untouchables " may be an exaggeration of the real life events that took place , but it fits together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences , some excellent acting , a memorable score , and a clever script .  the film takes place in chicago during the prohibition era where mobsters led by the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor to the demanding public .  elliot ness and a small force of men known as the untouchables attempt the impossible by trying to stop capone and trying to maintain peace and order .  however , as ness soon learns , in order to stabilize peace , you have to bend a few laws .  the fact that capone is evil is very apparent from the first few scenes .  the film begins with capone , played perfectly by deniro , declaring that he is not a violent man and he is a firm believer in following all laws .  the film then quickly transfers to the next scene in which one of capone's men bombs a restaurant that contains many innocent people including a little girl .  from this point we know capone is evil , not only because he kills without hesitation , but also because he is a lying bastard .  right from the first five minutes of the film , de palma has created a hatred towards capone and he shows that this man must be brought down at all costs .  this developed hatred is before the film's hero , ness , is even introduced .  i found this approach to be very clever because in a small duration of time there is a great amount of admiration for ness and an equal amount of hatred for capone .  the film only gets better from this point .  with the formation of the untouchables , there is a group of men wearing long , dark overcoats and hats .  they walk in unison and they only look forward .  as they walk down the streets they are observed and feared by citizens .  holding shot guns and pistols in their hands to stop criminals , this image of vigilantes must have influenced future films .  one that comes to mind is " the matrix " when neo , morpheus , trinity , and the rest of the gang first come into the virtual world .  wearing more futuristic outfits of the same 1930's style , the similarities between these two are countless .   " the untouchables " has some of the hippest , bravest heroes in any action film .  the four members were the only ones willing to go against capone's army .  each member of this special group also had their own characteristics that separated them from others .  elliot ness , played with perfect ingenuity by kevin costner , is a character that surely grows during the course of the film .  he begins as a man who is determined to follow all laws no matter how unfair they may be .  however , as the film develops so does ness .  his beliefs involving the law are shattered when he realizes that those he trusted are actually members of the other side .  he also begins to lose his stability when his adversaries begin to murder his friends .  his anger becomes so thunderous that he can no longer hold it in .  sean connery , who won an academy award for best supporting actor in his role , plays malone , an aging cop who decides to make one final run as a member of the untouchables .  malone acts as a mentor to ness .  he teaches him " the chicago way " to do things ; when they attack with a knife , you attack with a gun .  connery plays his character with the exact amount of wit and experience needed .  andy garcia does a wonderful job as george stone , a young man who is just becoming a police officer .  as ness grows , he begins to teach stone some valuable lessons that malone once taught him .  charles martin smith is also fantastic as the final member who attempts to use an income tax offense against capone .  smith is perfect for his role as he adds some valuable comic relief to the film .  the action scenes are also some of the most beautifully choreographed i have ever seen .  also very similar to " the matrix , " they are exciting and intense .  >from a western-like battle to the famous confrontation at the train station steps , the scenes are well thought out and well executed .  the score during these scenes ingeniously adds to the excitement .  its pounding drum beats act as a rhythm for the actors .  the combination of image and music is very impressive and also very effective .  although the real life untouchables may have been excessively glorified , this film is pure entertainment and contains a unique blend of great acting , great directing , and great action .  some scenes ( capone and the baseball bat , the train station ) have stuck in my mind for years and seeing them again will only make them more vivid . 
neg@ pos neg after enduring mariah carey's film debut , glitter , i'm reminded of a bit from chris rock's bigger and blacker .  in response to women saying that they can raise a child without a man , rock says , " you can drive a car with your feet , but that don't mean it should be done . "  to that i say , you can give mariah carey a movie , but that certainly don't mean it should be done .  sure , there are plenty of pop star film vehicles out there -- from the beatles' a hard day's night to the spice girls' spice world -- but none have been so vapidly pointless or laughable as glitter .  everything about this complete tripe is ludicrous .  start off with the story , which -- as gruesomely predictable as it is -- is the least offensive part of the movie .  the film is inexplicably set in the 80s , a period piece that really shows no sign of its period except for a few chicks in leg warmers .  worse yet , everyone's speaking late 90s hip-hop slang in what should be 1983 .  meant to be partially autobiographical , carey plays billie frank , a young singer in new york who struggles to overcome a rough childhood and abandonment by her alcoholic mother .  influential club dj julian dice , a . k . a . " lucky 7 " ( max beesley playing a bad mix of puff daddy and robert de niro ) , hears her sing on a track , and decides to make her a star .  in predictably rapid succession , billie and dice fall for each other , she starts hitting it big , dice gets jealous and starts acting like an ass , and suddenly billie's on " the roller coaster of superstardom . "  in the meantime , billie is on an emotional hunt for her missing mom .  i won't give away the ending , but -- honestly -- just think of unicorns and rainbows . . .  you'll figure it out .  the movie screams to be made with camp , and that could've been fun .  but the filmmakers thought making the bulk of glitter weepy and dramatic would be better .  what a mistake .  the brief attempts at comic relief -- as in a scene where an effeminate russian-sounding director gets wacky with filming billie's first music video -- go over like lead balloons .  instead , the audience at my screening tended to laugh loudest during mariah's most dramatic scenes .  which brings us to the performances , of which there's nothing good that can be said .  mariah is primarily seen with a wide-eyed deer-in-the-headlights look frozen on her face .  she actually looks scared during her one love scene .  but you have to wonder if the writing isn't even worse .  so much of the dialogue is so hackneyed and watered down for carey's virginal target audience that it's probably impossible for any actor to pull it off with aplomb .  even the characters couldn't have been written more absurdly .  they're all members of a barbie playset : the important film director who swoons , " billie , i'd love to put you in a movie i'm making , " and the big-time record executive who takes billie's demo tape and says , " oh , i'll make sure the whole team listens to it in the morning . "  everyone in the film is a device , and it's painful to keep watching just to see another one appear .  to say more would be a waste .  there's so much wrong with this film .  and , it pains me that mariah carey -- with her ego and sanity in such fragile condition these days , as evidenced by her multiple hospital stays -- will have to suffer through all the negative reviews she's likely to get .  but , then again , i had to suffer through her movie . 
pos@ pos neg the caveman's valentine starring samuel l . jackson , ann magnuson , aunjanue ellis , tamara tunie screenplay by george dawes green , based on his novel directed by kasi lemmons   * * * for more film , dvd and books about movie reviews , plus annual coverage of the toronto international film festival , visit _film freak central_ - http : //filmfreakcentral . net  | now with search engine * * *  a strange mixture of _shine_ , _basquiat_ , _angel heart_ , and grant morrison & dave mckean's graphic novel " arkham asylum " , _the caveman's valentine_ is a feverish tale of a homeless madman-cum-detective who , on the morning of february 14th , discovers a " valentine " just outside his new york cave : one of ella fitzgerald's strange fruit , stuck in the crotch of a tree--a young male model murdered and frozen to a branch .  believing at first that his imagined nemesis stuyvesant , shooting evil rays into his mind from atop the chrysler building , is responsible for the murder , romulus ( samuel l . jackson ) is put on the trail of an avant-garde photographer in the mapplethorpe mould , david leppenraub ( colm feore ) .  his minor sleuthing interrupted by the occasional delusional fit and bouts with an ecstasy of creation ( romulus was a brilliant julliard-trained pianist prior to his psychosis ) , romulus uncovers clues and harasses suspects on his way to convincing his police-woman daughter ( aunjanue ellis ) that even though he's a nut , that doesn't mean that he can't solve a high-profile society murder .  every moment an exhausting workshop of ideas , and every character the same , _the caveman's valentine_ is a concept so " high concept " that it suddenly became clear to me that the film fits into the comic book genre of entertainment , with romulus's " caveman " a slightly more mundane version of todd mcfarlane's urban noir hero , spawn .  with a long-vanished wife ( tamara tunie ) acting as a spiritual guide , the occasional social caste commentary , the secret base in a cave , a divergent genius personality with a network of informants and supporters , and a wickedly colourful arch-enemy , the film piles on the lurid comic book details and dizzying slapdash colours to such a lavish extent that i was vaguely surprised that the blue police cars weren't inscribed with " gotham pd . "  that being said , _the caveman's valentine_ can only really succeed as a heroic fantasy , a frank miller graphic novel that has the audacity to portray the blood staining a field of virgin snow expanding to form the shape of a heart .  the difficulties with the film spring from the misunderstanding that it somehow adheres to the conventions of a thriller or a police procedural when , in fact , _the caveman's valentine_ is a superhero fable that takes on the cause of the homeless ( again like mcfarlane's spawn ) while attacking the entrenched ruling classes in government and the arts .  it is no small detail that our hero , romulus , is not only named for a member of the ruling class who lived his life ( in legend ) without knowledge of his royal birth , but also that our romulus has turned his back on the comforts of the literati in favour of a mystical existence living in a cave in a park . in the romulus mythology , signs of romulus' royal blood is brought by twelve vultures , while in the film , the call to action for our hero comes in the form of not the carrion birds , but of the carrion itself .  whether or not romulus of _the caveman's valentine_ will found a nation , or , in the case of novelist george dawes green , upon whose novel his own screenplay is based , a franchise , the fact remains that _the caveman's valentine_ is easily the most misunderstood film of 2001 thus far .  it , along with m . night shyamalan's _unbreakable_ , is a mature cinematic extrapolation of the graphic novel format which has , since miller's seminal " the dark knight returns " , redefined the comic medium as one suitable for mature ruminations on psychologically sticky topics .  readers of sam keith's brilliant " the maxx " comic series ( or of mtv's short-lived animated adaptation of the same ) are already familiar with the idea of a homeless man placed in the position of knight errant and king of his own twisted demesne .  the failure of both " the maxx " tv show and of _the caveman's valentine_ ( not forgetting the initial backlash against _unbreakable_ ) suggests that the public may not be ready for america's surprising contributions to dark fantasy .  luxuriantly lit , brashly saturated , and comic-panel framed with a virtuoso grace by cinematographer amy vincent ( _death in venice , ca_ ) , while inhabiting robin standefer's ( _practical magic_ ) mesmerizing sets , _the caveman's valentine_ is an unremittingly gorgeous film .  kasi lemmons , following up her brilliant 1997 debut , _eve's bayou_ , which played on similar themes of manufactured realities and mysticism , fulfills much of her immense promise with a tale of seraphs and lost boys , artists and suffering .  _the caveman's valentine_ is an elegant and piquant expression of hope for justice in a tilted landscape .  clearly not for every taste , when approached with the correct paradigm , it is one of the most stunning and intensely fascinating films of the year : a redefinition of the hero archetype for a post-modern audience with urine-stained wool trench coats in place of blue tights and red capes .  _the caveman's valentine_ is a fine and a courageous film , crazy enough to suggest that the delirious yammering of an idiot savant is the best and truest paladin of order in the chaos of eliot's rat's alley wasteland . 
neg@ pos neg sometimes a stellar cast can compensate for a lot of things , and " pushing tin " certainly features some name stars who are going places : billy bob thornton , cate blanchett , angelina jolie , and oh yes john cusack who might not realize it at first , but he's actually the * veteran * among this quartet of fine-looking people .  sometimes a terrific cast like this can compensate for a lackluster screen treatment of an idea that has " hip comedy " written all over it , compensate for workmanlike but uninspired direction , compensate for an obnoxious score that would have anyone but the tone deaf screaming for the exits , compensate for clich ? d characterizations , compensate for embarrassing " you have to be joking " situations .  etc .  in " pushing tin , " thornton , blanchett , jolie , and cusack don't have an earthly .  from the opening sequence the film is in big trouble : squiggly , " quirky " credits , fake-looking passenger planes circling new york , and anne dudley's in-your-ear music making us wonder how she ever got that best original score nomination for " the full monty , " let alone won it .  but i , for one , wasn't ready to walk just yet .  so quickly we descend into a tightly-edited air traffic controllers montage which screams to us in large capital letters these people have a difficult job , yes , what with their frantic , mile-a-minute instructional personas , juggling planes and passenger's lives like some huge , real , mid-air video game .  hip , cool , demonic auctioneer nick " the zone " falzone ( cusack ) is the best in the biz .  of course .  until some hipper , cooler , leather-clad flyboy assist in the guise of russell bell ( thornton ) shows up to challenge falzone's finite air space .  boys will be boys and some heavy duty testosterone starts exuding , then the macho one-upmanship begins .  it doesn't stop with seeing who can juggle three 747s within a cat's whisker of each other .  oh no .  there are some broken hoop dreams , some wanna-see-how-fast-i-can-drives , and then the ultimate showdown : was that my wife i saw you with last night ?  director mike newell ( " four weddings and a funeral " ) must have read a different draft of this script because the one that's being acted out up there between newark , jfk , and la guardia doesn't have an ounce of subtlety , and newell has made some awfully good-and funny-movies before .  the antics of these air traffic controllers will make you cringe .  they'll make you frown in disbelief .  they'll have you constantly looking at your watch .  but wait !  there's still 100 minutes to go ! !  the film's only saving grace is blanchett , whose connie falzone is a spunky , brash , long island housewife who wants to better herself by taking art classes .  this is a wonderful accomplishment for the fine actress who has previously played a red-headed australian gambler ( " oscar and lucinda " ) and a tempestuous british monarch ( " elizabeth " ) .  but she's not enough to save the picture .  thornton looks terrific and performs solidly but his character is a joke .  jolie ( as russell's knock 'em dead wife ) isn't bad , but the up-and-coming actress disappoints by allowing herself to be displayed like a plaything .  cusack cracks gum , dons shades , and acts hip throughout but , like everything else in the film , his performance is forced .  in the last ten minutes or so , for some inexplicable reason , things start coming together and you begin to get a sense of how this film might have been , like the trailer teases .  but it's too little too late .  a fine cast aside , " pushing tin " is nothing more than an embarrassment . 
pos@ pos neg  " psycho meets the exorcist with no holds barred " .  a blurb like that sounds like desperate publicity for some low budget , third rate rip-off .  but no , this tacky plug comes from the poster for suspiria , perhaps italian horror director dario argento's most consistently successful film .  what impresses most in re-watching this surrealistic , supernatural thriller is that argento's directorial flair and stylish visuals are matched by a near-fully coherent narrative .  screenplays have always been his achilles heel ; confusing subplots , gaping holes , totally illogical incidents and reactions .  no question : argento has always been a better director than a writer .  fortunately , he gets the plotting pretty well right with suspiria , taking his cue from a book by thomas de quincey called " suspiria de profundis " .  the film's storyline suffers from no major lapses in logic , provided one can accept the premise of a ballet school being a front for a coven of witches .  jessica harper plays an american who travels to germany to further her studies in dance .  arriving at the school late at night in driving rain , she sees a girl leave and run into the storm in a clearly distressed state .  what happens next - and i don't make the comparison lightly - is a murder sequence that for intensity , shock value and sheer directorial flair ranks alongside alfred hitchcock's infamous shower scene in psycho .  it's quite possibly a homage to hitchcock , but with its baroque sets , graphic gore and brilliantly chaotic musical accompaniment by the gothic rock group goblin , this stunning sequence remains very much argento's own .  though nothing else quite equals the intensity of suspiria's opening 15 minutes , the film continues to be never anything less than engrossing as harper begins her own investigations and slowly comes to realise this is no ordinary ballet school .  we meet an assortment of slightly sinister characters , most notably the head ballet teacher played by alida valli in another one of those delicious sour-old-matriarch-from-hell roles she does so well .  several more violent murders ensue , including a startling scene in a deserted square where a blind man is . . . well , i wouldn't want to spoil things now , would i ? and the film's climax , staged amid secret corridors and hidden rooms , has a gothic ghoulishness that's most impressive .  the english language versions of most argento movies usually suffer trimming , and not just for the violence - deep red and phenomena , for example , have been appallingly hacked about .  fortunately , the cuts to suspiria ( about 7 minutes in this version ) have not adversely affected the film .  the dubbing of the italian actors into english is quite competently done , too , excepting one appalling and unintentionally hilarious effort with a conversation between harper and a professor about the history of witchcraft in the region .  and the soundtrack ?  it is interesting to imagine what power the film would have lost if it had been scored by someone else .  as it stands , the use of goblin's music in suspiria is outstanding .  apparently , argento played the soundtrack on location while filming so the actors could hear the music as they acted out their parts .  a stereo video player adds greatly to the viewer's overall experience .  even better , see suspiria in a cinema , where you'll get the added bonus of widescreen .  and the colours !  deep reds , eerie blues , a superb use of shadow and contrast .  the cinematography of luciano tovoli , whose more recent credits include reversal of fortune and single white female , is uniformly superb .  a nod also must go to production designer giuseppe bassan for his wonderful baroque interiors .  these kinds of settings are crucial to the atmosphere of argento's more surreal excursions , the other most notable example being inferno ( 1980 ) on which bassan also worked .  suspiria is the film that broke dario argento into the major league of european directors , and it is fully deserving of its cult status .  the gore is at times a little excessive and overstated - that's always been one of argento's shortcomings - but overall this is a fascinating , compelling example of italian horror . 
neg@ pos neg you don't look at a ren ? magritte painting and search for a deeper meaning .  you likewise don't look at one for 88 minutes straight .  surrealist works are notable for their quirks , and they are fun , but looking at one quirk for an hour and a half is exhausting .  that was my experience with i woke up early the day i died , a surrealistic , hyperactive comedy with no dialogue .  it's not a silent movie ; there is lots of atmospheric music , occasional screams and weird sound effects , but nobody ever utters an audible word .  though the film is distinctive , its unique style wore thin after about 20 minutes , and as it progressed , watching became a chore .  the only reason the script ever got filmed is because it was written by the pseudo-legendary ed wood , the man behind such " classics " as plan 9 >from outer space and night of the ghouls .  the joke , of course , is that his films are so bad , they're good ; so humorous in their inanity that they become hits .  i woke up early the day i died , unfortunatly , is so bad that it's really bad .  it stars billy zane ( titanic ) as a dangerous lunatic who overpowers a nurse , escapes from a mental hospital and proceeds to wonder around , stealing a car , clothes , and a load of money .  our thief reaches a cemetery , where he witnesses a bizarre ritual .  he falls asleep and finds himself , literally , in a hole , with his money gone .  for whatever reason , he is bent on getting his hard-unearned cash back ( considering how easily he stole it the first time , why didn't he just go steal some more ? ) .  he comes upon a list of the people who were at the mysterious ceremony and commences to seek out each of them and kill them if they don't have what he is looking for .  i don't think either director aris iliopulos nor ed wood realized that this would have made a glorious 20 minute short .  the subject and the style seem to have been made for it .  unfortunately , twenty minutes worth of material is stretched out to more than four times that length , and the film simply overstays its already dubious welcome .  it grabbed my attention in the beginning and gradually lost it as it went on , up to the point where halfway through i was already weary .  it might seem odd that a film as furiously paced as this one can be so tedious ; but the surprise will wear off when you consider how repetitive it is .  i woke up early the day i died is a comedy , i guess , though it could have fooled me .  unlike most ed wood films , this one tries to be funny and fails , instead of the other way around .  there's nothing inherently wrong with that , in fact , i think it would only make sense for someone who has been so " good " at making unintentional comedies to take a stab at a real one .  whether wood actually went for comedy in his script we'll never know , but in either case , this is a failure .  jonathan taylor thomas , christina ricci , summer phoenix , john ritter and others show up for short and pointless cameos .  ricci , for example , plays a prostitute .  her role consists of dancing around with zane in his motel room and then being thrown out .  thomas is an astonished onlooker as a woman gets thrown off a cliff .  was the home improvement teen heartthrob really that desperate for work ?  zane , meanwhile , occupies himself by making weird faces at the camera when he is not called upon to run around wildly and beat people up .  lack of dialogue makes him the ultimate caricature .  the carnival side-show climax manages to demonstrate everything that is wrong with this no-budget production .  it's desperately unfunny , but thinks it's the funniest thing since plan 9 ; , it's so spontaneously surrealistic it makes your head spin all while being confusing enough to make your head spin twice as fast in the other direction .  i hope another film is made from an ed wood screenplay for i woke up early the day i died is not a fitting send-off .   ? 1999 eugene novikov &#137 ; 
pos@ pos neg usually when one is debating who the modern queen of the romantic comedy is they will bring up names like julia roberts or sandra bullock .  others will mention meg ryan .  but for me , it's not even close .  janeane garofalo is not only the queen of the romantic comedy , she is the best comic actress in hollywood right now .  and it's a good thing she's starring in the matchmaker , because without her presence the movie would be bland , unfunny , and dull .  garofalo stars as marcy tizard , a top aide to boston senator john mcglory , who is suffering in the polls .  in an attempt to capture the irish vote , he sends marcy on a mission to a small irish town called ballinagra in search of other mcglory's that never moved to america .  unfortunately for marcy , her visit coincides with the town's annual matchmaking festival .  things get off to a rocky start for marcy though .  she has no hotel reservations ( for no rational reason ) and the tiny confined room ( tired old cliche' ) she has to stay in has a visitor in her bathtub .  his name is sean , and marcy finds him repugnant at first , so you can obviously tell where this is headed .  the movie runs into a few roadblocks .  for instance , the story is very thin .  none of the characters ( except the old local matchmaker ) are nearly as interesting as garofalo .  some of the characters , like the political aide played by denis leary , have wandered in from a completely different movie .  i think the director realized this and decided to throw in numerous shots of the beautiful irish scenery , and several close-ups of garofalo's winning smile .  the strange thing is that it works .  garofalo's charm and the irish scenery could carry the thinnest of stories , and it carries this one .

pos@ pos neg i don't box with kid gloves .  i don't play nice , i'm not a nice guy , and i never , ever , go easy on a film .  i consider it to be a breech of some sort of code of ethics for a movie critic .  however , i do some favors , and these often come in the form of points that i hand to certain groups due to the artistic bravery .  rigormortis , the production company that has been my prime example of how money does not need to motivate filmmaking , gets several of these points each time .  i still , however , will not go easy on them .  they recently sent me a vhs copy of their down with america trilogy ( which begins , quite wittily , with a disclaimer that they are not trying to undermine america with the making of this film . ) and i decided to spend an hour of my day watching it .  in the famous lines of many martyrs , i have no regrets .  well , i do have some regrets , but that is not the point in the previous sentence .  the point of it was that down with america was a film that , from a critical standpoint , did not entirely disappoint me .  sure , the risky use of vhs instead of super 8mm or 16mm was a pain , and the natural light was one of the most annoying things about public access films , but the movie itself was fairly enjoyable .  down with america concerns a government agent , needless murder , and a book containing everything from the unabomber's manifesto to the 1995 apple computer profit report .  like the previous films of rigormortis that i have reviewed , it displays an off-kilter humor and intelligence ? it succeeds in making me laugh where countless studio films fail .  the best way to see this film would be as a parody of the countless conspiracy films that we have been drowned in since the paranoia of the 80s .  a dying movement from the day they started , these paranoid `thrillers' had the government always covering up something and had the same favorite word : `roswell . '  in down with america , the line `roswell' is highly absent .  with an about ten minute running time , down with america effortlessly sidesteps every clich ? that the conspiracy films fell into , makes jokes at them at the same time , and provides us with funny and memorable characters .  again , i have seen movies that have gone on two hours with characters i couldn't care less about .  the film , as previously stated , concerns a federal agent ( peter roach ) , an obsessed librarian ( meri stevens ) , a mystery man ( joe kaczkowski ) , and two people obsessed with silence in the library ( robb sherman , kevin flowers ) .  the plot : a book containing the secrets of all anarchists is hidden in ? a public library where it can be viewed by all .  from there we go into a delightful parody .  the federal agent claims his sovereign right to alter the truth , the librarian goes on a diatribe about the sanctity of books .  we spend our time laughing at fairly idiotic jokes that are performed much too well considering the lack of coaching of the cast .  although the actors and actresses are in small roles and give a whole new meaning to `no-name' , it ends up being the no-name people who do a good job , delivering better performances as comic villains than half the crap that hollywood turns out .  for once , i don't have a url that i know offhand to give you as to where to locate the film online .  i can only say that you should find my previous reviews of l'auto and les x-files and look up the rigormortis productions site in and of itself .  it's almost as much fun as the film .

neg@ pos neg  " desperate measures " is a generic title for a film that's beyond generic .  it's also a depressing waste of talent , with the solid team of michael keaton and andy garcia unthankfully thrown thankless lead roles , not to mention once-cool director barbet schroeder sadly continuing his string of not-cool flicks -- this thriller is more " before and after " than " reversal of fortune . "  the movie is a big disappointment , and yet it's somewhat easy to see what motivated such big names to attach themselves to it -- the premise is both promising and intriguing .  too bad the execution's all wrong , though , because the set-up of " desperate measures " boasts some rather enticing elements that deserve to be put to far better use .  san francisco cop frank connor ( garcia ) is a single parent with a troubling dilemma -- his son matt ( joseph cross ) is stricken with cancer which only a bone marrow transplant can push into remission .  even worse , the only compatible donor is violent sociopath peter mccabe ( michael keaton ) , currently serving a life sentence for multiple murders and other various crimes against society .  connor tries his best to convince mccabe to go along with the surgery ; he's at first reluctant , but reconsiders after he realizes he can plan his escape at the hospital .  when he does make a run for it , connor offers close pursuit , but for different reasons than his superiors ( including the crusty brian cox ) -- they want to take mccabe down , while connor needs to keep him alive , or all hope is lost for his little boy .  one misstep " desperate measures " makes is in its underdevelopment of matt's illness .  what's needed are more details as to exactly why mccabe is the only bone marrow match that works ; there would seem to be other possible contenders somewhere in the country , and thus many of the ways that connor endangers the lives of himself and those around him by attempting to keep mccabe alive are just a little too hard to swallow .  take , for example , a scene where mccabe is trying to make a getaway by climbing over an elevated passage tunnel connecting two sections of the hospital .  the police have their spotlight and guns aimed right on him , and what does connor do ?  he shoots the spotlight out so that mccabe can continue his flight .  connor knows very well what dangerous deeds this guy is capable of , and yet never seems to think that mccabe will eventually get to and try to harm his son .  whatever .  to be fair , though , the lack of story background is the least of the movie's problems .  first and foremost is how cheaply " desperate measures " trades the potential of it's opening scenes for the routine action ballistics of its final hour .  once mccabe escapes , the film becomes the fugitive in reverse and with no thrills .  there are countless scenes where the good guys catch up to keaton only to have him grab a hostage and get away .  also , the movie is so intent on giving you a hoot-inducing , lip-smacking villain ( the ads have compared peter mccabe to hannibal lechter , natch ) that it completely casts garcia's frank connor by the dullsville wayside ; " desperate measures " appears to like its antagonist so much more than its protagonist , and the movie's head-scratcher of a send-off confirms this .  there is some good to be found amongst this mess , particularly in the acting department .  cast against type , michael keaton's understated menace is highly effective .  although he's not given much believable to work with , andy garcia plays off a taut emotional chord .  joseph cross , as garicia's ailing son , is surprisingly unsentimental , and marcia gay harden lends solid support as a doctor who becomes a major player in the unfolding chaos .  this cast does its best to camouflage the sorry plot as it chugs towards an inevitably happy ending , but most is lost .  it goes without saying that " desperate measures " needs an operation of its very own . 
pos@ pos neg contact is a film that tries to do several different things .  it is intended to present a realistic picture of what alien contact might be like , to restore a sense of wonder and mystery to the issue of extraterrestrial life , to raise questions about science and faith and how they would be relevant in such a situation , and to tell a personal story of a romance between the astronomer dr . ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) and the religious spokesman palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) .  the film succeeds wonderfully at its first two goals .  the portrayal of the communication from an alien world is much more reasonable ( albeit less immediately engaging ) than , say , the cold-blooded destructiveness of the invaders in independence day or even the complex process of abductions and genetic hybridization that forms the ongoing plot line of tv's the x-files .  the aliens in contact seem to be like us-they are more curious than anything else .  they know we exist , they want us to know that they exist , and they would like to make the next step and communicate in person .  the film wisely refrains from showing us the aliens directly , and between the characters' ongoing speculation about the extraterrestrials and the outstanding visuals in the climactic yet enigmatic scene when arroway arrives on the alien world , that sense of wonder and mystery comes through with a force rarely seen since stanley kubrick's 2001 : a space odyssey .  most of the film , however , takes place on earth , where there is an extended public debate on how to respond to these aliens .  scientists are enthusiastic , ultraconservative religious leaders are wary , and government officials are caught somewhere in between .  the debate is fueled largely by dr . arroway's atheism ; she seems the obvious choice to pilot the spacecraft for which the aliens have provided blueprints , but many are wary of sending an atheist as humankind's representative to another species .  the film is partly successful in raising and exploring these questions , especially when it reaches a conclusion that suggests that the two approaches - science and faith - could be viewed as complementary rather than diametrically opposed .  still , the film falls a little short in its representation of this conflict as it exists in american society .  the two " sides " are represented primarily by arroway and by far-right fundamentalists , but in reality probably 80% of americans are neither atheists nor far-right fundamentalists .  palmer joss occupies something of a middle ground , but he ultimately becomes distracted by personal motives and comes across as a less-than-ideal spokesman for any ideology .  then again , the film does concentrate mostly on public debate , which does , after all , tend to be dominated by extremists , rather than on dinner-table or college-dormitory discussions .  contact is accurate in its portrayal of these issues , then , but only within the narrow scope to which it confines itself .  the film's one clear failure is in the portrayal of the romance between arroway and joss .  for one thing , it resorts to the tired movie clich * that two attractive people will immediately fall in love as soon as they appear on the screen together , as there does not seem to be any other reason for their instant mutual attraction .  the romance rarely , if ever , sheds any light on the characters , although it occasionally tries and fails - joss's explanation that he quit the priesthood because of the celibacy requirement ( " i guess you could say i'm a man of the cloth , but without the cloth " ) , for example , is more like a punchline to a joke than character development .  instead , the romance mostly seems to exist for the sake of later plot developments .  granted , this is a plot- and idea-driven film and the characters are secondary , but this just seemed like laziness on the writers' part more than anything else .  the successes of contact , however , far outweigh its failures .  even if the social commentary had fizzled altogether ( which it didn't ) , the simple yet mysterious story of alien communication still would have made it a memorable film .  contact doesn't quite cover all the bases , but it covers about as much as one could hope for in a two-hour film , and its rejection of big-budget theatrics for a more realistic story is certainly admirable .  and i would not be surprised if , ten years from now , contact is mentioned in the same breath as 2001 and blade runner as one of the finest examples of sophisticated and intellectually relevant science fiction . 
neg@ pos neg a follow-up to disney's live-action " 101 dalmatians " that's better , more entertaining than the first ?  just as unlikely .  with " 102 dalmatians , " the disney studios have proven that when it comes to going to the dogs , more is definitely * not * the merrier .  1996's " 101 dalmatians " certainly wasn't the greatest movie-going experience of all time , but it did feature glenn close in an outrageous , larger-than-life performance .  in addition , we had two amiable leads in the form of jeff daniels and joely richardson , and lots and lots of adorable spotted puppies .  this time around there seem to be fewer puppies on the screen , and close's facial and physical gyrations are starting to feel as old as the 53-year-old actress under that startling black and white wig of hers .  but that's only half the problem with kevin lima's laborious film .  what makes " 102 dalmatians " such a collosal bore is its embarrassing attempts at humor ( here almost single-handedly foisted on a wisecracking macaw who thinks he's a dog , voiced by eric idle ) , its rabid plotlessness ( cruella goes after puppies again ; winds up in goo again ) and most of all , the incredibly wooden actors who plays the romantic " heroes " of the piece , a welshman named ioan gruffudd and the blander-than-bland alice evans as a parole officer named chlo ? .  gruffudd is cute and harmless , perhaps , but evans can't even aspire to that .  the dogs upstage them both , of course , but in the case of evans , even close's split ends are more animated .  bad acting , however , seems to be a requirement for this sequel , since g ? rard depardieu shows up as a french furrier with a haircut like robert de niro's in " men of honor . "  jean pierre le pelt is a flamboyant fashion designer with a penchant for fine furs and depardieu's over-the-top antics mimic those of the campy close flail for flail , and wail for wail .  france's most popular export besides brie has long since turned into a caricature of himself , and in " 102 dalmatians " the producers milk that realization for all it's worth--le pelt likes to refer to the furry little critters as " poopies , " par example ( and ad nauseum ) .  the finesses of the script ( attributed to four screenwriters no less , and far removed from anything dodie smith ever dreamed up ) are quickly dispensed with , since all it takes for a paroled cruella to be shaken from her years of successful aversion therapy in the slammer is the tolling of big ben ( ? ) .  that done , it's back to the mansion to roll around in her heretofore off-limits sables and minks and a plan to skin those little dahlings for the sake of a hooded designer gown .  the dogs are pretty cute--try making a puppy look otherwise--but that's pretty much all they are .  there's always the feeling that there's a trainer off in the wings , coaxing the dogs to open doors , or pick up their food bowls in unison , or pop a tape into the videocasette recorder .  savvy holiday goers should skip " 102 dalmatians " and pop the original 1961 animated classic into * their * vcrs instead .  it's one dalmatian less , but 101% more satisfying . 
pos@ pos neg apparently , director tony kaye had a major battle with new line regarding his new film , american history x . i don't know the details of the fight , but it seems that he is not happy with the final product , and nearly removed his name from the credits altogether .  i've heard about this kind of thing happening before , and it makes me wonder how much input a studio has over the films they produce .  as it is , i found american history x to be an extremely good film , not just because of tony kaye's focused look at the touchy subject of racism , but because of a powerful , charismatic performance from edward norton .  it's hard to believe that it has only been two years since norton's fantastic role in primal fear , but , here he is now , starring in his own film and making himself a star .  norton is one of those performers who becomes his character , and his work in american history x is one of the very best performances this year .  he plays a young man named derek vinyard , a skinhead living in venice beach with his brother , danny ( edward furlong ) , mother ( beverly d'angelo ) , and sister , davin ( jennifer lien ) .  the film opens with a flashback , in which derek brutally kills two black men vandalizing his car .  we find out that this lands him in prison , and the film from that point is seen through the eyes of danny .  in the present-time of the film , danny is in high school , and eager to follow the footsteps of his brother .  much of the film is told in flashback , and we see the path that leads to derek's adoption of white supremacy .  when derek is released , having served three years in prison , he finds that his brother is now a full-blown skinhead ; derek , however , has given up the violence , and tries to get his brother to understand why racism and the violence that comes with it are bad things .  what makes this all interesting is that these two young men are not stupid , thoughtless people -- they are intelligent and articulate , and voice their beliefs in disturbingly straightforward terms .  it's hard to make a controversial movie and not preach , but kaye has found the right note for his material .  because american history x is a mainstream film , there has to be a redemption phase for our main character -- some people may think that this is the only way to make him sympathetic .  i partially disagree with this , because , although i do not advocate racism in any way , it's interesting the way kaye presents derek -- he is a loud , obnoxious man , but he's also very smart .  the reasons for why he becomes a skinhead are believable -- his father was arbitrarily killed by a group of black men .  it's clear that he's passionate about his beliefs , and that he's not just a punk looking for an excuse to beat people up .  of course , it helps that kaye has an actor as talented as norton to play this part .  it's astonishing how frightening norton looks with a shaved head and a swastika on his chest .  in addition to getting the look just right , he's perfect for this role -- derek requires intelligence , depth , and a whole lot of shouting , and norton does it all with ease .  even when he's at his meanest , derek has a likable quality to him , and that's a gutsy approach when telling a story about a skinhead .  what adds depth to the story is a subplot in which the principal of danny's school ( avery brooks ) becomes obsessed with purging the hatred from danny .  the other performances are all terrific , with standouts from furlong , d'angelo , and lien .  visually , the film is very powerful .  kaye indulges in a lot of interesting artistic choices , and most of them work nicely -- lots of slow-motion and strange camera angles add to a moody atmosphere .  but , like a lot of movies lately , american history x skims past greatness in the last few minutes .  although the climactic scene is very moving , the picture ends with a pretentious , preachy resolution featuring a brief narration from a character who was killed .  for a movie so smart a subtle up until that point , it felt like a slap in the face to be hand-fed a theme in such a simplistic way .  it makes me wonder what , exactly , tony kaye disliked about the final version of his film .  perhaps this last scene was the problem .  it's hard to imagine any director not being at least partially pleased with a film this good -- in a time when so many movies are timid and weak , american history x manages to make a compelling argument for racism without advocating it any way . 
neg@ pos neg i can't recall a previous film experience where the fairly good time i was having turned as sour as quickly as it did during feeling minnesota .  for forty minutes or so , i was lured into a loopy if occasionally over-wrought romantic comedy , and i was even giving keanu reeves the benefit of the doubt .  then , rather suddenly , i was clubbed over the head with a nasty bit of violence ; shortly thereafter , i was whacked in the gut by another .  feeling minnesota is a film that made me feel violated , as though i had trusted writer-director steven baigelman to bring me a cool glass of water and instead he threw acid in my face .  feeling minnesota tells the story of a topless dancer named freddie ( cameron diaz ) who finds herself in deep trouble when her boss red ( delroy lindo ) suspects her of stealing from him .  red's punishment is to force freddie to marry his bookkeeper , sam clayton ( vincent d'onofrio ) , who is far from the man of freddie's dreams .  enter jjaks ( keanu reeves ) , sam's estranged younger brother , who arrives at the wedding just in time to catch freddie's eye and have sex with her in the bathroom .  united in their mutual attraction and their mutual loathing of sam , jjaks and freddie take off together , but sam isn't ready to let them go without a fight .  freddie , meanwhile , isn't ready to let sam's money go without a fight , and thus begins a series of violent confrontations .  there is both style and substance to the beginning of feeling minnesota , as baigelman opens with an effective montage showing jjaks and sam's intense sibling rivalry as boys , and their mother ( tuesday weld ) sending jjaks away to live with his father .  it does a great job of setting up jjaks' unstable life , a life which has landed him in trouble for petty crimes and always trying to please his family ; reeves' wounded look is just right for jjaks .  the wedding sequence includes a number of nice moments , most notably the aforementioned bathroom scene in which a simple question is given a very funny spin .  most important , baigelman begins to establish the connection between freddie and jjaks with humor and economy , as in a scene where they both spontaneously begin singing along to the replacements' " i will dare " on the car radio .  you would have every reason to expect that relationships -- both familial and romantic -- would be the focal point of feeling minnesota .  unfortunately , you would be dead wrong .  i suppose i should have expected daisies and valentines after an early scene in which red threatens freddie as she tries to avoid the wedding , but i certainly didn't expect what i got .  what i got was yet another in a long line of recent films trying to ride the tarantino wave by mixing gags and brutality , or rather creating gags about brutality .  suddenly , the story of romantic entanglements and family conflict becomes a story about a corpse , and everything which had come before degenerates so completely that virtually nothing is recognizable .  the sibling rivalry not only becomes little more than an excuse for one round of beatings after another , but there is no consistency to the characterizations .  vincent d'onofrio turns in a manic performance as sam , whose jealousy , competitiveness and apparent sense of inferiority seem far more in keeping with what we know about jjaks , while reeves turns into a framed hero too reminiscent of chain reaction , and both of them spend most of the second half of the film screaming and covered in blood .  there are films which have managed to employ a radical shift in tone successfully ( jonathan demme's something wild and neil jordan's the crying game come to mind ) , but they didn't try to draw an audience with the promise of relatively innocuous entertainment .  i don't want to dismiss baigelman's successes out of hand -- he gets a fun performance out of dan aykroyd as a crooked cop , and some well-crafted comic moments -- and it is not his fault that fine line has chosen to promote feeling minnesota as a light-hearted caper .  it _is_ his fault that he violates his own characters for the sake of shock value , and that he can't make his two halves into a whole .  feeling minnesota left me feeling used , and there's not much funny about that .

" rounders " ' success , then , is owed to its proficient cast and intriguing portrayal of a world not many viewers will be familiar with .  the dialogue may be filled with terms that only true players will grasp , but you don't have to speak the language to understand the words - a statement that pretty much sums up the effectiveness of the whole show .  matt damon , fresh off his " good will hunting " hot streak , is perfect for the role of mike mcdermott , a young law student with a tremendous gift for gambling .  but after losing all of his tuition money in a killer high-stakes match with russian poker aficionado teddy kgb ( john malkovich , deliciously hammy ) , he shifts his focus to scholarly matters , leaving his true area of expertise far , far behind .  things change , however , when mike's old buddy worm ( edward norton ) re-enters his life - it seems worm , just out of jail , owes a hefty sum to nasty thugs , and is counting on his friend's superlative skills to help him pay off the debt .  that " rounders " ' story quickly molds itself into a conventional , predictable tale of redemption doesn't hinder its potency .  director john dahl , infamous for his neo-noirs " red rock west " and " the last seduction , " gets extremely convincing mileage out of the been-there , done-that plot mechanics by trumping up the relationship between mike and worm .  damon and norton bring so much to their roles that they'd be worth catching even if " rounders " ultimately folded , but the movie ups its fascinating ante by contrasting their wildly different ways of winning .  any sequence where the two men sit at the table together is an unarguable highlight .  if only the other character interaction was as successful , " rounders " might merit consideration when it comes time to number the year's best films .  current " it girl " gretchen mol is sweetly appealing as mike's girlfriend jo , aware and weary of his seedy past , but her scenes with damon number too few to be very effective .  john turturro's aging mentor and famke janssen's tempting siren , both interesting sketches , are hampered by the same limited screen time .  and as a wizened judge , the great martin landau makes memorable a role that's mostly a plot device - he's on hand mostly to sort-of save the day and provide a voice for " rounders " ' moral .  that moral , by the way , is " our destiny chooses us , " and it's something of a surprise when " rounders " supports this solemn proverb by eschewing the conclusion you might expect ; mike does learn from his mistake , but neither the mistake nor the way he learns from it is what it initially appears to be .  in the end , " rounders " sees gambling as less a mere addiction than a potential art form , but the poker itself is only a metaphor for a much larger picture .  the road to true fulfillment lies within the realization and exercising of your natural passions , the movie espouses , no matter what they might be .  here , low-rent lowlifes like worm just aren't cut out for the cards .  screenwriters david levien and brian koppelman entertain and educate in their quest to vividly render a culture that's often generalized by movies ; even complete poker neophytes should cross the line from observers to participants when the movie gets to its concluding game scene .  inside every adventurous filmgoer , there is a desire to be taken someplace new and exciting , and that's the precise allure of " rounders . "  it ultimately matters not that a few of our tour guides feel partially-realized or that the journey itself is cluttered with sites we've seen before , because the final destination is a satisfying one .  in the end , " rounders " holds a winning hand . 
neg@ pos neg susan granger's review of " the musketeer " ( universal pictures )  hollywood launches another assault on classic literature with this $50 million adaptation of alexandre dumas's novel that's strong on action but weak on drama , fusing hong kong martial arts with 17th century swordplay .  the story chronicles the adventures of the dashing d'artagnan ( justin chambers ) as he leaves his village of gascogne , headed for paris , to join king louis xiii's elite guard , the royal musketeers , and to search for the man who killed his parents 14 years earlier .  this puts him in conflict with the formidable febre ( tim roth ) , vicious henchman for conniving cardinal richelieu ( stephen rea ) .  the traditional musketeer trio - aramis ( nick moran ) , athos ( jan gregor kremp ) and porthos ( steve speirs ) - don't offer much help so he turns to the feisty francesca ( mena suvari ) , chambermaid to the queen of france ( catherine deneuve ) .  scripter gene quintano and director-cinematographer peter hyams are primarily interested in the derring-do , as evidenced by choreographer xin-xin xiong's elaborate - but not original - stunts , including a fast-paced stagecoach chase , a tavern brawl on rolling barrels , high-wire acrobatics with the combatants dangling from ropes , and a ladder-fight sequence .  filmed in southern france , the scenery , sets and costumes are spectacular , but the lighting is too dark and editing is filled with choppy , restless mtv'ish cuts .  as the swashbuckling d'artagnan , bland calvin klein model justin chambers buckles where he should be swashing , totally lacking on-screen charisma , not to mention acting skill .  mena suvari , so impressive in " american beauty , " seems like a contemporary interloper in the royal court .  on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " the musketeer " is a cinematic but shallow 3 .   " all for one and one for all " ?  not this time 'round . 
pos@ pos neg synopsis : in this cultural exploration , a chinese american computer engineer named fang ( peter wang ) decides to take a month-long vacation to visit his sister mrs . chao ( shen guanglan ) , her husband mr . chao ( hy xiaoguang ) , and their teenage daughter lili ( li qinqin ) in beijing after 30 years of separation .  fang brings his asian american wife grace ( sharon iwai ) and his college-aged son paul ( kelvin han yee ) along , both of whom don't speak chinese .  the encounter between the two families allows the audience to compare the eastern and western cultures as well as the ambitions of individual characters .  opinion : sometimes a film is plot driven .  sometimes it's a character sketch .  a great wall ( 1986 ) can be called a culture sketch , as opposed to a character sketch because it gently compares a chinese american family to a beijing family .  fang's family is thoroughly americanized .  fang is an upper middle class professional who enjoys jogging and argues with his boss .  his wife can't cook chinese .  his son has a white girlfriend and complains of racism when fang encourages him to befriend an asian girl .  meanwhile fang's beijing sister advocates absolute loyalty to the 'work unit . '  her husband is a retired official who has heard rumors of american depravity ( homosexuals running the streets ) , and her daughter lili longs for american freedoms in a youth culture where studying for college entrance exams is the most important thing in life .  the two families spend a month slowly learning about each other .  there is no ultimate 'answer' or final comprehensive understanding after the month-long vacation .  the film is neither here nor there ; it's a neutral , meandering , gentle , portrait of life on both sides . 
neg@ pos neg fantastically over hyped , godzila finally lumbers onto the big screen .  the film opens with footage of nuclear testing on the french polynesian islands , then an attack on a boat from some beast , and finally we join dr . nick tatopoulos ( broderick looking about 17 years old ) doing some research in chernobyl .  some shady u . s government guys appear , and ask him to come to an island where they have massive footprints , from what looks like a giant lizard .  and what's more , this beast is heading for new york .  gulp !  although godzilla should be a non stop roller coaster ride , and at some points it is , there is something curiously uninvolving and unexciting about this movie .  the main faults lie with the acting and writing , common problems with 'summer blockbuster' movies .  broderick is pretty useless as the hero , with no humour or a 'tough guy' image .  while emmerich's previous summer flick , independence day ( 1996 ) had wisecracks and action from jeff goldblum and will smith , this has neither .  also , maria pitillo , as broderick's former girlfriend , is just as useless , with a chronic disability in acting .  she's incapable of showing emotion , speaks every line in the same way , and basically she's total crap .  it's up to french actor jean reno to save the day , and indeed he does , turning in a campy performance as a french secret agent .  shame he has such little screen time in such a overlong film .  hank azaria also turns up as a crazy cameraman named 'animal' , and he adds a little life to the picture .  also making an appearance is harry shearer ( probably best know for doing voices in the simpsons ) as a slimy news reporter .  o . k , so the acting is not up to par , but it never is in these movies .  but what about the script ?  well , that's not up to par either .  emmerich and screenwriting pal dean devlin seem so caught in the destruction of new york city that they forgot to write a script .  the dialogue is banal ( broderick looks at a lot of fish and utters 'that's a lot of fish . ' ) , and the character development is non existent ( reno plays the typical frenchman ( 'no croissant ? ' ) ,  broderick forever remains a geeky scientist . )  also , the film is seriously lacking a sense of humour .  the jokes that are uttered are pathetic , and there's an 'hilarious' running gag about siskel and ebert .   ( the mayor is mayor ebert , and is assistant is called gene !  ha ha ha ha ! . )  the plot is dire , and in the end just rips off jurassic park ( 1993 ) by having lots of baby godzilla's ( i . e .  velicorapters ) running around new york .  right , so the script and acting suck .  but what about the special effects ?  thankfully , they're are quite good .  godzilla is an impressive piece of cgi , although we don't see much of him because the movie is so dark .  the destruction of new york is pretty well done aswell .  but although they are impressive , they can't save godzilla from being an hugely disappointing and boring movie .  the movie goes on for far too long aswell , and it can't seem to decide on a ending .  and of course , the ending itself leaves possibility for a sequel .  let's just hope one never arrives . 
pos@ pos neg the long kiss goodnight ( r ) meryl streep tried it and failed .  even pamela anderson lee made an attempt but fell flat on her well-bared assets .  however , geena davis could very well become the first bankable american female action star with the long kiss goodnight , a preposterous but incredibly fun action thriller directed by her husband , renny harlin .  davis plays samantha caine , a mousy suburban school teacher and mother whose memories only go back eight years .  with the help of ethically questionable private detective mitch hennessey ( samuel l . jackson ) , she slowly remembers--and reclaims--her past as charly baltimore , tough-as-nails cia operative .  needless to say , with the reappearance of samantha/charly comes the appearance of an assortment of no-goodniks out to erase more than her memory .  shane black netted a cool $4 mil for his script ; i'm not so sure if his prose is truly deserving of such a hefty price tag , but for what it's worth , it delivers the goods .  like black's previous work , such as lethal weapon and the last boy scout , the script juggles some impressive action scenes with funny , quirky dialogue .  the humor especially works well in this case , for the story is so preposterous that the laughs help to keep things from taking things too seriously .  but there's no argument that the more unbelievable sequences are original and entertaining as hell : who can resist the sight of davis tossing her daughter from a hole in her house into the nearby treehouse or chasing after a car . . .  while ice skating ?  jackson and davis make a good team .  jackson is funny as ever as ever ; in fact , his spirited line deliveries , especially when he first appears , are more than reminiscent of his work as jules in pulp fiction .  as good as he is , the one who should benefit the most from this project is davis , who shows much promise as an action heroine .  what makes her so effective and why she should succeed where streep and lee failed is that she doesn't take herself too seriously .  she is obviously in on the joke , slyly taking jabs at herself and at the situation .  this is not to say that she doesn't need work--sometimes she lays on the " toughness " a bit too thick and comes off too much as a caricature .  but should the public embrace the film and , in turn , the notion of a kick-ass female , davis could have found her special niche .  it seems as if davis and harlin's first collaboration , the middling pirate epic cutthroat island , was just a dress rehearsal ( albeit a very costly one ) for long kiss , in which the wife-husband team hit their action stride .  anyone simply looking for a fun , escapist entertainment that requires little-to-no thinking will find this film to be a more-than-welcome kiss . 
neg@ pos neg the premise of this movie is , well , pretty far-fetched .  tom berenger plays shale , a mercenary who is temporarily out of work ( those fools at the cia have denied his existence just because he and his buddies botched a job in cuba ) .  fortunately , his girl friend ( diane venora ) , a teacher at christopher columbus high school in miami , gets her knee cap broken by a disgruntled student , creating a job opening for shale as a substitute teacher .  not telling his girl friend , who might object on pedagogical grounds , he creates a number of fake higher degrees for himself ( from yale , harvard , princeton , et al ) and begins his tenure as a high school teacher .  the students ( junkies , drug dealers , gang members , sleazy sluts , ice-pick wielders . . . you  get the picture ) don't really take to him right away , so he hits one in the face with a can and breaks a few fingers .  this gets their attention to a certain extent , so he tells them the story of the vietnam war : " see , some homeboys from the north tried to muscle in on the turf of the homeboys from the south . "  oh yeah , now they can dig it ; the problem is just that nobody ever explained it properly before .  but wait !  there are drugs being dealt in the school itself !  and behind the whole scheme , in cahoots with the head gang , the kod ( no , not " cod " , but " knights of destruction " . . . really ! ) , is none other than . . . the  upright , ex-cop principal , played by the forgotten ghostbuster , ernie hudson !  so shale does what any good teacher would do .  he gets his buddies together , they gather together a bunch of bazookas and other major weapons , explosives , and cool stuff like that , and they have a big showdown against the drug dealers and kod at the high school .  ok , so the premise is not just far-fetched , it's downright dumb .  if this were a hong kong action comedy , we might just accept it , but it takes itself far too seriously to be truly fun .  oh , it has its moments ; how one can truly hate a movie in which huge ( really huge ) amounts of cocaine are delivered in school busses ?  and to be fair , it is almost never really boring , as the action is interrupted by only short sequences of actual story .  but over all , this is pretty much a made-for-tv movie with more ( and bigger ) explosions and more foul language .  in fact , it reminded me of " miami vice " without the production values , babes in skimpy bikinis , and pastels .  if you can sneak into the theater without paying , go for it .  otherwise , wait for video .  the flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast .   * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha !   * * * pretty good , bring a friend .   * * * * amazing , potent stuff .   * * * * * perfection .  see it twice .

neg@ pos neg the tagline on random hearts reads " in a perfect world , they never would have met . "  in a perfect world , i never would have seen this movie .  the biggest flaw is that 20 minutes into this film , kay chandler ( kristin scott thomas ) and dutch van den broeck ( harrison ford ) are the only two major characters alive ; resulting in little doubt that they will end up together at some point during the laborious two-hours-and-then-some production .  dutch is a sergeant in internal affairs at the district of columbia police department .  kay is a congresswoman from new hampshire .  although they both think they are happily married , their spouses are cheating with each other behind their backs .  dutch and kay are soon widowed when a plane goes down carrying their partners ; they subsequently discover the affair .  the rest of the film is the pointless , unrealistic and often-times boring story of their researching the sexual relationship that they were blind to , and getting to know each other in the process .  two sub plots are of little help to the already problematic film .  dutch is trying to arrest a fellow officer , a task that seems rather ordinary for hollywood fare .  all the great stereotypes get pulled , including my personal favorite of the key witness that makes bail and is murdered soon thereafter .  kay's distraction from the film's primary focus is her campaign for re-election and attempts to shield her 15 year old daughter from the truth about the father she put on a pedestal .  these sub plots could have made for semi-interesting points , but the film seems afraid to explore politics or mother-daughter relations in depth , and consequently suffers .  random hearts' two primary characters seem to live in shells .  although both kay and dutch are given their own sub plots , they seem to never deal with anyone other than themselves or each other .  there is plenty of opportunity , dutch having a partner and kay having close friends and her daughter , but the movie shies away from exploring these relationships .  veteran actor and director of this film sydney pollack , and critically acclaimed up-and-comer dylan baker both have cameo roles , but be careful not to blink too much or you will miss them both .  other than its weak plot , it is hard to criticize random hearts .  however , it is also hard to compliment it .  had the film taken some small risks and more fully explored its extra characters and plots it may have tasted more like a well frosted cake , rather than the dry one that equates to be . 
pos@ pos neg in 1994 , an insider's look at a scandal-ridden run for the democratic presidential nomination ( closely based on clinton's 1992 campaign ) was written anonymously ( former newsweek writer joe klein later claimed true authorship ) .  now , the book , primary colors , has been made into a movie , directed by mike nichols , and , in light of recent presidential scandals , seems to be more relevant than ever .  but the film is more than a diatribe against , or a paean in praise of , the president .  it is a fascinating look at the political machinery , and the ethical quagmire , that surround modern politics .  jack stanton ( john travolta ) is the governor of a small southern state running for the democratic presidential nomination .  he is charismatic , but has several flaws which threaten to doom his campaign , and strains his relationship with his wife , susan ( emma thompson ) .  the film is told from the point of view of henry burton ( adrian lester ) , grandson of a civil rights leader , who is swept away by stanton's ideals and helps to organize the campaign .  he joins political strategist richard jemmons ( billy bob thornton , looking an awful lot like james carville ) , and campaign advisor daisy green ( maura tierney ) .  governor stanton's past repeatedly pops up to haunt him , a fact that his chief rival , lawrence harris ( kevin cooney ) , consistently uses to his advantage .  to help clean up the stanton campaign , jack and susan bring in an old friend , libby " the dustbuster " holden ( kathy bates ) .  the acting throughout primary colors is superb .  it would be worth seeing the movie for bates' wild performance alone .  she enlivens the atmosphere with energy in a truly boisterous performance .  travolta does a fair clinton impersonation as governor stanton , although his accent does stray a little .  emma thompson delivers a strong performance as his suffering wife who can't let anything show that might hurt the presidential run .  the problem with political movies is that they tend to alienate over half of their audience by promoting one side or the other , or else the movie is vague to the point of boredom .  primary colors treads lightly on this issue .  though stanton is clearly portrayed as a democrat , and there are a few minor barbs thrown in the way of republicans , the movie touches on few actual political issues .  in fact , most of the " bad guys " are fellow democrats on the same road to the white house .  rather than issues , the film is primarily concerned about scandals and spin control .  although the film strays into some obviously non-clinton territory , it is difficult to completely separate it from reality ( particularly when certain scenes seem to highlight the president's current troubles ) .  primary colors' chief problem is its length .  it runs about 15 minutes too long .  there are some scenes which could have easily been cut .  for example , midway through the film , the candidate gives a speech to an assembly of laid off machinists .  the scene's only apparent purpose is to establish stanton's character , which has already been done in similar scenes earlier in the film .  the extra length isn't long enough nor tiring enough to be annoying , but it mars an otherwise excellent film .  republicans , democrats , and political agnostics should all be able to find something to like in primary colors .  it's a funny , and at some times shocking , look at the modern political process .

" ghosts of mars " is lock , laughing stock , and barrel all your standard carpenter fare : dingy interiors , cluttered exteriors , inane dialogue , lots of leather , scarred , crazed-looking aliens , and lots and lots of weaponry .  the film often and always explodes into warfare without warning--spontaneously , stupidly .  carpenter might like to think he's made a western here but it's a western without any real heroes , villains , or border conflicts .  it's just the shootouts minus a hissing snake plissken .  i never thought i'd miss the guy but i do .  it's not * all * the same , however .  dubbed the " one-note wonder " for his minimalist music soundtracks , carpenter seems to have graduated from simplistic ( yet effective ) scoring by highlighting his action with loud , screeching guitar work .  fortunately this drowns out a lot of the dialogue .  the final exchange between henstridge and , er , cube though is both audible * and * priceless .  mars has proven an infertile breeding ground for hollywood in the last year or so , what with the stillborn " mission to mars " and " red planet " ( with val kilmer ) .   " ghosts of mars " sadly adds to those disappointing returns ( in its opening weekend it was overshadowed by a bunch of sequels , among them " american pie 2 " and " rush hour 2 " ) .  the irony is that the mars in carpenter's film feels sadly absent .  there are occasional references to the red planet , of course , but the film might as well have been set in perth amboys than on earth's closest neighbor .  two things keep " john carpenter's ghosts of mars " from getting a huge slap upside the head .  1 .  henstridge keeps her top on ( miraculously ) , and 2 . the film doesn't pretend to be anything it's not .  what that means , however , is that fans of superior , intelligent , grade a sci-fi/horror are singularly out of luck .

"  i don92t think that i = need to even begin to explain all the impossibilities of this situation ever occurring , so i won92t .  the movie develops into josie trying to find the life that she never led in high school .  interwoven flashback scenes show us just how much of a dork she truly was , and she appears to be heading down that road again .  fortunately for this lame production , other characters do appear that make some of these high school scenes both humorous and remotely interesting .  they include the predictable love stories , between both a student ( jeremy jordan ) and a teacher ( michael vartan ) , to show that josie is really two people in one body .  also , her younger brother and opposite , rob ( david arquette ) comes into her new found life and even causes a rare scene that is mildly provocative .  the humor found in this film is actually quite amusing .  typical for teenage films , it is chalk full of sexual innuendoes and condom humor .  one scene in particular features a certain classroom activity involving bananas and latex that is absolutely hysterical .  most of the other jokes are straight forward high school humor that anyone who has ever been to high school can appreciate and will enjoy .  but those still don92t = recover for the total lack of quality in this movie .  following this trend of high school movie rules , comes the general acting .  it is even worse than the trend of overplaying a scenario from film to film .  in this case , drew barrymore is absolutely painful to watch .  she is required to play her character on two levels , having some very black and white transitions .  and although some scenes are written to be particular shades of gray , she seems to hold that color throughout all of her screen time .  at one point she is alone with an obvious love interest on a ferris wheel , and is expected to him on an adult level , since he is one , her teacher .  but she never seems to get out of the gray area , and in doing so she makes a mockery out of his otherwise good performance .  following barrymore is the pitiful molly shannon ( saturday night live ) .  she seems to be limited to playing an ecstatic character that no one can relate to , and draws the attention of an audience as simply unrealistic .  it is these " qualities " that prevent the aforementioned condom scene from being one of the few decent .  luckily there is one great performance to emerge out of this otherwise bleak film .  david arquette ( scream ) takes home the prize for being able to stand out in an ensemble performance that is absolutely pathetic , and not have his brilliant acting ruined .  and as a central character he gets to take on his own mini-plot , which is one of the few well done parts of never been kissed .  in a dazzling cherry-on-the-sundae type piece of work , he does an absolutely hilarious tom cruise impression from the 1983 hit , risky business .  never been kissed is a mediocre film at best .  the predictable plot has become so overplayed in hollywood , that it is sickening to watch time and again , and this film is no exception .  the acting is just as bad , but there is the one positive presence of david arquette to add some light .  unfortunately , the bottom line is that the movie will be a success , because teenagers will pay to see any trash . 
pos@ pos neg warning : anyone offended by blatant , leering machismo had better avoid this film .  or lots of blood & guts , men against men and mano-et-mano stuff .  in other words , it's a walter hill film !  with a john milius script !  i always picture these guys getting together and producing a movie between arm-wrestling matches .  these films always contain male characters i have a very hard time identifying with , probably due to the likelihood that any meeting between them and me would result in my arm being ripped off and then my subsequent death by beating with said limb .  and we got tough guys galore , here ; drug-running banditos by the dozens , all dirty and sweaty and pretty ill-tempered , overall ; a secret task force of army commandos who are in the area to cover-up ( supposedly ) any connection between the government and the drug runners ; and lots of shit-kicking texas dirt farmers who'd as soon shoot you between the eyes as look at you .  in particular , we got nick nolte as one hard-ass texas ranger , powers boothe as the drug kingpin , michael ironsides as the leader of the secret army , and rip torn as the local sheriff .  torn is the sympathetic figure of the group ; he smiles before shooting anyone .  as to women . . .  well , i've never seen jane fonda or meryl streep in a walter hill film , and at this rate , i doubt i ever will .  women exist here to look good , comfort the man , and get argued over .  gosh !  just like the old days . . .  frankly , this is a pretty good movie , if you can accept the premise and can take the macho stuff .  the cinematography is excellent , the cast of characters is broad and has texture , the script is quite good , and the film lets you keep up with what's happening yourself , without spelling it out to you .  i appreciate a film that makes me have to think to keep up .  finally , there's lots of sam peckinpah slow-motion shoot-ups . 
neg@ pos neg  " first rule of fight club is , don't talk about fight club . "  this quote deals directly with my opinion of this film , because quite frankly , it's not even worth mentioning .  director david fincher ( seven ) has completely gone over the edge .  with crude humor , an intolerable script and 2 hours and 19 minutes of pure torture , i'm surprised i didn't walk out .  this just goes to show that hype kills .  it's very rare that a film so hyped up as " fight club " turns out to be noteworthy , and this is no exception .  the story goes like this .  edward norton is an insomniac trying to enlighten his dull life by going to a variety of disease therapy sessions , until he meets marla ( helena bonham carter ) .  norton claims that she is wrecking his pleasurable lifestyle , when he spots her at a session that he also attended .  apparently the disease sessions help them see what life is like , literally living in pain .  why any person would think of such a thing is beyond me , but things do get worse .  norton is soon assigned to a job that calls for traveling , and it's on a plane that he meets tyler durden ( brad pitt ) .  the two men develop a bond , and go out to a bar , and by golly after they get drunk , the two pitiful characters fight .  how do they come up with this stuff ?  anyway , their fighting catches other pathetic loser's attention , and a club is formed .  out of all this mess , there manages to lie a message .  fincher shows us that society is like robots .  we work in our jobs doing things step by step , and want out .  our insanity gets to our brain and makes things worse than they really are , and we blame it on others .  call me crazy , but this is common knowledge .  i think fincher was acting as if the film is moodier and more poignant than it really is , which is probably one of the reasons it fails miserably .  even with two good actors , and a solid actress , they only manage to weaken the story .  i couldn't help but hide my face in shame when norton beats himself up into a bloody pulp .  it just shows how desperate the script is for attention .  i guess brad pitt was right for this role , because i felt like beating him up myself .  his bothersome and depressing character , made me disgusted at his 20 million fee .  it only showed me that he was in it for the money and nothing more .  helena bonham carter however really had no purpose .  she just popped up on screen , mumbled some lines , smoked and left .  this continues for what seems like 6 hours .  the film drags on and my headache gets bigger , while " fight club " nears what i think might be the end .  unfortunately by then , the film hits rock bottom .  though the conclusion kept my interest for a mere 5 minutes , it backs down again and continues to move at a snails pace .  on a side note , the trailer shows the only redeeming elements of the film , that coincidentally lasts the same amount of time that they did on the trailer .  fincher will hopefully regret making this film or at least learn a lesson .  concentrating on the atmosphere or a particular key moment , won't do any good if everything else is in need of support .  also , i'm afraid that immature men might respond to the film's violence .  the last thing the world needs is people praising a leader of a pointless cult .  when the film ends , i'm just glad to get home and take some advil .  you'll either enjoy what the film has to offer , or agree with ed norton when he says " this is so f * * * ing stupid . " 
pos@ pos neg the idea at the center of the devil's advocate , which is , thus far , one of the three or four best films of 1997 , is that no matter what decision is made , evil will triumph -- god is a trickster , satan is a humanist -- " the last humanist " .  he appears in many guises , and seduces many men and women -- in his own words , " vanity -- by far my favorite sin " .  al pacino plays this role with relish , and gets to chew some delectable lines ( " lemme givya a piece o' inside wisdom on god . . . " , " i have a million names . . . " ) , as john milton -- the devil .  the main idea -- that he can appear as anyone , in any form ( in this case , a buisness man ) , harkens mainly back to terry gilliam's the time bandits .  but the film , is something else , something original .  part of what makes it so very good , is that it never takes itself too seriously -- it dabbles with morality , vanity , death , and child abuse , but doesn't try to become any profound study of power .  this is a marvelous confection -- cocky , funny , thought provoking .  it is also entertaining .  there is no way you could possibly predict the ending -- it pulls back upon itself , drawing purely out of the mind's eye .  the final shot is more creative , more daring , more challenging , then anything in cinema since the white sock in the coen's fargo .  the central themes are fascinating ( sometimes reminiscent of james' the turn of the screw , and oates' accursed inhabitants of the house of bly ) , and the product that is built around it really wows .  its nice to know that things like this are still being made . 
neg@ pos neg  " the beach " is a structurally confusing film that i can only describe has having multiple personality disorder .  every forty minutes of this two-hour film begins with a new theme , virtually discarding what has been set up in the preceding act .  it starts off purposefully as a film about an innocent man seeking new thrills in a dangerous environment .  but then in the second act , the mood of the film abruptly changes and it becomes a story about a love triangle on an idyllic island paradise that evokes visions of " blue lagoon " .  forty minutes later , the mood changes once more , and it becomes a dumbed down version of " lord of the flies " where an isolated community is discovered , where their moral code touts maintaining a sense of bliss at all costs .  by the time it's over , you can only scratch your head and wonder what this film was really meant to be about .  the main character of " the beach " is angst-ridden richard ( leonardo dicaprio ) .  he travels to the netherworld of bangkok where back alley merchants push their wares upon unsuspecting tourists and scantily clad women brazenly ask if you're looking for a good time .  richard's voice-over tells the audience that he has come to this place because he is bored with his life and feels that one way to reinvigorate himself is to let go of the familiar and to enter into a world of the unknown .  this seedy environment is just what richard is looking for .  he checks into a fleabag hotel where he meets the crazed daffy ( robert carlisle ) .  he seems like a raving lunatic , obviously high from heavy drug use and looking as if he is afflicted with some sort of psychosis .  though his jagged behavior would distress most of us , richard listens to him as he speaks of a mysterious island that contains the most perfect beach that anyone has ever seen .  moreover , the island itself flourishes with enough hemp plants that can make a small city high for life .  captivated by the idea , he asks two other hotel guests to join him on his journey .  they are worldly etienne and the alluring francoise , who have also come to thailand for reasons similar to richard's .  once they finally arrive at this paradise , however , the mood of the story shifts to richard's growing desire for francoise .  this particular plot point is weak at best because there is absolutely no question in my mind that francoise will wind up with richard .  etienne is about as exciting as fluffy , white sand .  it's odd that etienne never sees this coming , but paradise has a way of hiding potential threats just out of view .  and once the three stumble across the hidden community ( mood shift imminent ) , more events transpire that depict its hidden dangers .  for example , there are marijuana fields close by patrolled by armed guards .  and the lagoon in which they swim invites the occasional shark .  there are several ideas that are introduced in " the beach " and each one could merit its own feature-length film .  there's the man vs . nature angle , the love triangle angle , and the utopia-gone-awry angle .  but the film meanders so tremendously that its entire purpose becomes blurred .  dicaprio , as a result , has an almost impossible time of trying to embody the different states of mind that he and the film goes through .  consequently , the audience has an equally difficult time trying to keep up . 
pos@ pos neg not too many people know who james whale is , but it's a safe bet that a good chunk of them have seen his movies .  if we are to believe the semi- biographical gods and monsters , whale would have wanted it to be that way .  this is an insightful , haunting exploration of the last days of the frankenstein and bride of frankenstein director , and it is notable for introducing one of the first complicated gay characters in a hollywood movie .  gods and monsters has no interest in being a biopic of whale's life because it tracks only the final few days of his life , and it's probably a better movie for it .  it's focus is on whale's ( ian mckellen ) untraditional and deceptive lust for heterosexual gardener clayton boone ( brendan fraser ) .  it begins with whale ( a fairly talented artist , aside from being a director ) asking boone to " sit for him , " ( pose for a portrait ) .  at first , boone doesn't realize that whale is gay and grows fascinated with the old man .  when he does discover whale's sexual orientation from his dedicated and protective maid ( lynn redgrave ) , he is frightened , refusing to sit for the guy .  but he comes back , only to storm out again , disgusted with whale's " locker room talk . "  boone returns yet another time , after whale promises to tone down the aforementioned " locker room talk , " and finds their platonic relationship to be strengthening .  meanwhile , jimmy himself is suffering from hallucinations and mental attacks as a result of his stroke not long ago .  his ailment leads to desperation and depression , which build to the point where he is forced to ask boone for an incredulously big favor .  what is perhaps most sensational about gods and monsters is brendan fraser's bravura performance ; up until seeing this film i intensely disliked the young actor because of his tendency to ruin the movies he is in ( blast from the past , for example ) .  i was surprised how expressive an actor he proved himself to be here .  this is impressive because his character's dialogue is minimal , with mckellan doing most of the talking .  that requires fraser to act through body language ; a difficult skill to master , but something he proves capable of doing well .  this is not to ignore mckellan's oscar nominated turn .  he earned that nomination with his touching performance here ( although , at the risk of sounding like a philistine , i would have chosen his performance as the nazi in apt pupil for the nomination ) ; an understated , compelling gem .  whale dreaded being remembered solely for his work in the hollywood horror genre , and he thought hollywood to be the equivalent of a battlefield .  he rejoiced in being free from it , only reluctantly going to receptions with fellow movie people .  in the end , perhaps , it is what killed him : the memories of hollywood and war blending together to form a living nightmare .   ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ; 
neg@ pos neg capsule : the much anticipated re-adaptation of the pierre boulle novel comes to the screen as a dark and a little dreary film with lots of chases and fighting , but very little intelligence .  visually there is much to like about this version , but the approach is to take an adventure after the style of gulliver's travels and treat it as an action film .  that makes it a film without much center .   , 0 ( -4 to +4 )  pierre boulle , author of the bridge on the river kwai , wrote planet of the apes ( a . k . a . monkey planet ) , the novel , as a social satire .  it reads a lot like a fifth book of gulliver's travels .  humans discover a planet in which the roles of apes and humans have been reversed , not unlike the roles of horses and humans on jonathan swift's island of the houyhnhnms .  the novel moves somewhat slowly to create some suspense in revealing all the things most film fans know to be true about the nature of the planet .  it seems to me there is also a statement about human cruelty to animals , but perhaps i was just looking for that .  when rod serling adapted the novel into a film released in 1968 , he added a number of serling touches , familiar from episodes of the twilight zone and changed the ending to make it more serling-ish .  the final irony of the original version has become film history .  without it there could never have been a " planet of the apes " film series .  i can surmise only that serling ran into serious script problems in how to handle the tricky question of language .  in the book the apes had their own language and the human eventually learned that language .  that could have been done in the film , but that would have required the entire film to be subtitled for the non-ape-speaking .  serling avoided this by having the apes speak english and , of course , there is some justification for that by the end of the film .  justifying why the apes spoke english may have even been the inspiration for his surprise ending .  but serling never tackles the all-important question of why a supposedly intelligent human never shows any curiosity or even surprise that the apes speak his own language , a language they had no opportunity to ever hear .  few viewers questioned this serious plot hole , however , and the film has become well respected in cinema history .  partial credit at least should go to jerry goldsmith whose extremely inventive score is one of goldsmith's best if not his best .  when the film's success called for sequels , the filmmakers turned up the violence and they added well-intentioned , though not very subtle , political messages about what was happening in the united states of the 1960s and 1970s .  while the first film had a little shooting of guns and what was there seemed a little half- hearted , by the second film , beneath the planet of the apes , there was a good deal more violence and from that point on the series had a lot of violence and chases .  the series concluded with battle for the planet of the apes in 1973 .  now director tim burton tries his hand at adapting the original book again .  for those who thought that the 1968 version was not very faithful to the book , burton's new version is even less faithful .  first , he does not really reverse the roles of the humans and the apes .  he has them both be intelligent , articulate races battling for a dominance of the planet currently in the hands , uh , make that paws , of the apes .  that could be a good story too , but it is not planet of the apes .  as with the mission impossible films and so many other cinematic homages to the third quarter of the last century , the title makes promises that the filmmakers have no intention of honoring .  in 2029 leo davidson ( mark wahlberg , not this world's most expressive actor ) works on a space station increasing the intelligence and usefulness of apes .  then a convenient time storm sweeps him up wizard-of-oz-fashion and drops him on an alien planet .   ( yes , he survives this storm , but then no storm is perfect . )  he quickly finds , not greatly to any surprise he shows , that on this planet apes rule and humans drool , but everybody talks .  and the language they talk is earth- english .  apparently it does not even occur to leo that there is a mystery that needs to be explained about that .  the fact it does not occur to leo and apparently didn't occur to tim burton either is the heart of the real horror of this film .  both just assumed that if apes were going to talk the language they would speak would be english .  in any case having one talking race dominating another makes this not a look at human-animal relationships and more one of the master-slave relationships .  outside of sudan and a few other countries this is a less relevant topic .  leo is captured to be used as a slave but also is discovered by ari , played by helena bonham carter .  ari is an attractive ape with close ties to high political power .  she is bent on making the world a better place .  perhaps in a previous draft of the script she was called hil-ari .  in any case with makeup that stifles her usual pout , carter is just about as attractive as she has ever been in a film .  she may want to consider this to become her standard look from this point forward .  it is not long before leo escapes with some human and only a couple of sympathetic apes .  this is a further abandonment of the source material .  the chase severely limits the interplay of ape and human and the examination of each's place in this reversed society , each important in the book .  we cannot see how the society works because most of the screentime society has broken down .  we see the humans either separated from the apes or fighting them .  burton chooses visceral thrills over cerebral ones at almost every turn .  this is a miscalculation , as characters so lacking in empathy value are difficult ones to place much emotional investment in .  they are basically chess pieces and the viewer has little reason to root for them to win .  the 1968 script had little subtlety , with lines like " i never met an ape i didn't like , " but at least we cared for what happened to taylor , the main character .  most of what this film has to offer is in the visuals .  the visual work is spotty but generally nicely done except that so much of the film takes place in the night or in fog .  this tends to limit close looks at the makeup .  in general it seems much improved from 1968 .  the makeup team is led by rick baker instead of john chambers , who did it for the 1968 version .  in 1968 chambers makeup was a jaw-dropper .  it was realistic enough to almost be believable but flexible enough to show emotion .  chambers is good , but if anyone had a chance to best him it would have to be baker .  today audiences have higher expectations ; baker's visualization is really an improvement .  these visuals work nicely .  what does not work is the wire- assisted leaps some of the apes make .  they look like they were inspired by the physics- defying leaps of crouching tiger , hidden dragon .  apes spring incredible distances .  some of the best scenes are apes running into battle looking like they have ape posture , but when they start flying through the air the effect is lost .  one final visual problem is that the film frequently shows its budget in what should be spectacular battle scenes the camera shows us only a small group of people close-up .  since the days of lon chaney and boris karloff few actors have crossed over to stardom in a role that required heavy make-up .  the one actor who has a shot is paul giamatti .  it is not that his lines are so good , most are silly jokes .  but he delivers them very well .  he was always a watchable actor , but has not yet made stardom .  as the ape-trader limbo he over-emotes to overcome his ape make-up , but does it very well .  in doing so he makes himself the most interesting thing on the screen .  he is probably the best thing in the film and conjures up memories of peter ustinov's performance in spartacus .  as an in-joke there are several lines in the script borrowed from the 1968 film and an old ape played by charleton heston becomes an allusion to the first film by itself .  danny elfman's score has a nice primitive feel , but jerry goldsmith's 1968 tour de force score is a real classic .  that score and the whole film will be remembered when the 2001 film is forgotten .  i rate the remake 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . 
pos@ pos neg in brief : best bleak comedy film since heathers .  full of wonderful swipes at the fifteen minutes of fame mentality that feeds so much of modern american pop culture .  go see it !  so , i prepared for this film by watching a moving interview on " hard copy " with pam smart , the new hampshire media teacher who was convicted of engineering the death of her husband back in the 1980's .   " hard copy " 's diane diamond asked smart what she thought about nicole kidman's fictionalized portrayal of her in the new film to die for .  smart replied that she thought kidman's character came off as a dumb , vicious tramp and she thought that the publicity the new movie generates might just hurt her chances in her latest court appeal .   ( smart was convicted and given a life sentence for her part in the murder of her husband . )  smart's got a point .  it wouldn't be the first time that the public took the better scripted and well-acted movie version of an event as the absolute truth over the duller and far less artistic real life version .  however , given a choice between the mass media 'happening' of the real event and the fictionalized movie , i would definitely opt for the later .  real murderers rarely have dialogue as witty as what buck henry has written for this movie and smart , while pretty and alluring , is no match for the cinematic charms of nicole kidman .  to die for begins in a town called little hope , new hampshire , the archetypal dry and intellectually barren american suburb .  the story concerns the ambitious suzanne stone and how she tackles the obstacles between her and her life long ambition of being 'on tv . '  of course , one of those little obstacles turns out to be her dull and unambitious husband larry , played by matt dillon .  but , with a little imagination , some charm and raw sex appeal and a rather novel approach to junior achievement , our heroine manages to overcome the nay-sayers in her life , at least temporarily .  kidman triumphs in the trashy role of suzanne .  i have never really been all that fond of this actress but she shows a wonderful flair for comedy in this picture .  her portrayal of the incredibly shallow and dumb femme fatale resonates .  kidman knows a star-making role when she sees it and she plays the conscience-deprived suzanne as the ultimate career driven , post-feminist uber-temptress from hell .  she is ably abetted by wonderfully demented comic dialogue , which kidman delivers in a unselfconsciously funny way .  at one point suzanne is expounding on her knowledge of world events to her future husband and sister-in-law .   " you know , " she knowingly exclaims , " gorbachev would still be the leader of russia or whatever , if he had just had that ugly purplish thing removed from his head . "  her husband beams at suzanne's profound knowledge of world politics and then proudly proclaims that this qualifies her to be the next barbara walters .  this is very close to pop culture bashing heaven , folks .  the other standout performance in the film is delivered by joaquin phoenix .  he plays jimmy , a burned out teenager who becomes addicted to suzanne's sexual favors .  kidman's character , vapid though she is , is a sort of suave beacon of success to jimmy and his lost friends russell and lydia , winningly portrayed by casey affleck and alison folland .  phoenix looks like the very embodiment of gen-x slackerhood ( as envisioned by tabloid tv , of course ) .  his jimmy has the dead eyes and demeanor of a kid who knows that he ain't going anywhere , ever .  phoenix reacts to the sexy suzanne with a sort of obsessed amazement and he makes us believe that a loser character like jimmy really would be willing to kill for someone like suzanne , someone who actually noticed him .  gus van sant ( drugstore cowboy , my own private idaho ) direction is first-rate .  he keeps the pacing in this not-quite-thriller snapping along .  van sant rightly keeps the focus of this movie on the amoral suzanne and doesn't stop to proselytize the audience about the rightness or wrongness of her actions .  van sant trusts his material and trusts his audience to 'get it' without stopping to explain what is funny about this all-american story .  the screenplay , by buck henry , is absolutely great and includes some of the best bleakly comic lines i've heard since heathers .  henry's story is a blast against the shallowness of the american media and the mindlessness of fame , yet the screenplay delivers this sharp message by focusing on just a few characters .  henry ably manages to avoid diluting his story by aiming at too many targets and the result is a crisp and funny mini-classic .  danny elfman did the original music for this movie and he delivers another eccentric , loopy score that strongly echoes his themes for edward scissorhands .  either film score would make wonderful background music for halloween trick-or-treat parties .  all-in-all , a wonderful production , well worth your seven bucks !  to die for : a columbia pictures release directed by gus van sant .  written by buck henry score by danny elfman starring nicole kidman , matt dillon , joachin phoenix based on the book by joyce maynard .  rated r - for language and mature themes .

neg@ pos neg if you have ever seen fox tv's special car chase programs , you'll have a good idea about the content of ronin , the new action " thriller " from director john frankenheimer .  the film involves a mysterious briefcase , that several groups of terrorist want to get their hands on .  an irish women , dierdre ( played by the truman show's natascha mcelhone ) , hires a group of mercenaries to assist her in getting the briefcase .  among the people she hires are sam ( robert de niro ) , vincent ( jean reno ) , and gregor ( stellan skarsg ? rd from good will hunting ) .  dierdre's groups assignment is too seize the briefcase while the current owners are transporting it .  they accomplish this task , but a traitor is in the bunch and the briefcase is soon on the run again .  the briefcase stays on the run , as the movie leads the viewer through several plot twists that are badly executed .  the writer seemed to be attempting to make a smart action movie , but failed to understand that just because there are surprises , it doesn't add too the credibility of a senseless script .  the plot twists get no reaction because they come at a time where no one cares what is going on , after the apparent climax of the film .  but to add to the excitement , as i mentioned earlier , there are endless car chase scenes .  they are unrealistic and fail to add anything to the story .  don't get me wrong , i love car chases , but they were overdone and too long here .  we never do find out what's in the briefcase , but i doubt anyone cares by the time they finish sitting through this two hour long attempted thriller . 
pos@ pos neg if the current trends of hollywood filmmaking continue , we are probably five or six years away from the moment when the 1980s would become the next golden age of movie nostalgia .  although some hollywood products already use the last decade as a background for their stories ( mostly in ironic way , like grosse pointe blank and romy & michelle's high school reunion ) , some time should pass before the good memories of that era overcome the bad ones .  until that happens , 1980s would be remembered as the decade of greed , when the revolutionary ideals of 1960s turned into its cruel , materialistic opposite and the money became the only thing that matters .  contemporary movies are good in illustrating what was bad for the people who had to live in those times .  one of such movies , one that probably brings the essence of 1980s to the screen , is william friedkin's to live and die in l . a .  the money isn't just the symbolic motive in the film , it is the major elements of the plot .  rick masters ( willem dafoe ) is an ex-convict who used his artistic abilities in order to become one of the best counterfeiters in l . a . being too intelligent to fall into police traps , and ruthless enough to eliminate anybody or anything that could jeopardise his career , masters managed to elude law for years and became well- connected .  richard chance ( william l . petersen ) is a secret service agent , adrenaline junkie whose life gets new meaning after his partner got killed by masters .  however , his plans of bringing the counterfeiter down meet one obstacle after another .  finally he sets up a final sting , but his superiors deny him the necessary money .  being frustrated , and against the reluctance of his new partner john vukovich ( bill pankow ) , he decides to get the money by robbing underworld courier .  their plan backfires with almost tragic consequences when their target turns out to be undercover fbi agent , but chance decides to carry out his scheme anyway .  like french connection , one of his previous masterpieces , this friedkin's movie was inspired by real life .  gerrald petievich , author of the novel that later served as basis for his screenplay , spent many years working as a secret service agent .  that turned to be useful for the portrayal of that law enforcement agency , not much utilised by hollywood .  secret service millieu was also cleverly used in order to bring the viewer into the decade of greed ; the beginning scene where the movie's hero works as a part of presidential security detail is a nice opportunity to hear reagan's speech that could illustrate the political and economical notions of those times .  ultramaterialistic and egotistical view of the world is shared by almost any character in the movie .  willem dafoe brilliantly portrays dangerous and intelligent psychopath , whose ruthlessness and lack of any moral fibber doesn't seem like affliction in the reagan years ; on the contrary , those qualities actually makes masters socially acceptable .  compared with him , and all the other side characters that want their " piece of the action " , two heroes on the side of law seem like losers .  instead of being a classical good guy , secret service agent richard chance ( portrayed by william petersen in his most impressive role so far ) is nothing more than a lunatic whose adrenaline addiction and madness work against his better judgement ; his sidekick , who should serve as those " better judgement " is a weakling and sentimental fool that gets suckered in the end .  in such surroundings of moral decay , the not so happy , yet surprising ending doesn't seem out of line ( although the very last shot leaves too much questions unanswered ) .  the dark atmosphere of l . a . - city of glamour and moral decay - is nicely captured by william friedkin's directing skills .  the tight and realistic scripts with memorable characters ( portrayed by such capable actors like john turturro , dean stockwell , debra feuer , darlanne fleugel and steve james ) gave opportunity for friedkin to use another gimmick that made him famous in his 1971 masterpiece - great car chase .  that scene alone , with lot of realism , thrills and surprise twists , is worth seeing the rest of the film .  the soundtrack , provided by now almost forgotten band " wang chung " , is also one of the more memorable of that decade .  in every case , to live and die in l . a . is one of the rare movies in which hollywood actually tries to tell some unflattering truths about the world and succeeds in it . 
neg@ pos neg last summer , a feature-length version of the avengers hit theaters to the tune of a unanimous critical panning .  based on the famous 60's television show , the film was an enormous box-office flop and a huge disappointment for warner bros . a year later , the studio is up to their old tricks again , with the unnecessary revival of the robert conrad program the wild , wild west .  but it sounded promising : the same tag-team of star will smith and director barry sonnenfeld , who both contributed to make men in black such a financial success , is at the reins again .  and co-star kevin kline is attached to the project , as well as a substantial budget to spice up the special effects .  i mean , what could possibly go wrong ?  the answer is just about everything .  wild wild west is a cinematic abomination - a film that was so entirely pointless to begin with that it is never given a proper chance to get out of the gate .  there are a lot of fancy special effects , and a handful of distinguished actors who try desperately to tunnel through the inane plot and make a lasting impression .  but the script is so deliriously uneven , the entire movie so off course , that no human being or technical achievement has a chance to salvage it .  at square one , we have a bizarre case of casting .  will smith plays james west , a renegade cowboy who was originally played by white actor robert conrad in the tv series .  my guess regarding the casting of african-american smith is a simple one : the actor + a cozy summertime release = big bucks for all those involved .  smith is a very talented performer who usually brings swift assurance to any comic relief material , but this is not an ideal role for him .  he's too much of a joker .  i heard that initial casting included george clooney in the lead role , and frankly , that sounds a lot more plausible .  what makes matters worse is that smith goes through the role with such self-assurance in his eyes ; you can practically sense his contentment with the fact that he knows wild wild west will be a huge hit at the summer box office .  the plot involves west and cross-dressing government agent artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) , who are assigned by the president to recover a group of kidnapped scientists .  the trail leads to the diabolical dr . arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh ) , a man with no lower body who speaks in a dry , witty southern accent .  loveless has taken the country's top technical minds hostage so that they can assist in his deranged plan of total government control , using lethal superweapons to destroy entire towns .  one such weapon is an 80-foot mechanical tarantula , bearing eight spindly legs of thrashing metal and spewing enormous fireballs left and right .  the visual effects that bring this metallic bug to life are spectacular , seamlessly blending computer-generated imagery with the western surroundings .  unfortunately , all of these effects seem so detached from the story , and can do little to support the film's plot deficiencies , which are undoubtedly the main problem .  wild wild west is a running gag that never truly works .  most of the jokes , usually care of smith , die on arrival .  if it's one thing that could possibly be the saving grace , it's the performances , and even they are mostly off-kilter and poorly delivered .  kline is admirable , but he has little to do but invent silly devices on the spot .  salma hayek is wasted as the romantic interest , because she is viewed as little more than that - window dressing to look pretty and create conflict between west and gordon .  branagh , an esteemed shakespearean actor and director , adds marginal enjoyment to the film .  but even he is so utterly weird and over-the-top .  rarely is a film so lost in itself as wild wild west is .  i suppose there's always one turkey of the summer season ; a highly anticipated , big-budget release that manages to completely disappoint .  wild wild west is such a movie , and will probably go down as one of the biggest disappointments of 1999 .  but it is highly unlikely that this will go down in defeat at the box office .  perhaps after this , audiences will be less assured when they see will smith's name stamped on a summer movie .  after such hits as independence day and mib , wild wild west is not an impressive addition to the resume .

neg@ pos neg this season needs another serial killer movie like kathie lee gifford needs more public devastation .  but lo and behold , here comes " switchback , " and fast on the heels of such stalker fare as " kiss the girls " and " i know what you did last summer . "  but " switchback " is an undoubtedly weak genre entry , as the material it covers is old and tired , and the filmmakers rarely sustain enough energy to make any of the proceedings interesting .   " switchback " opens with the murder of a babysitter and the abduction of the young child she's watching .  we learn late in the game that the kid belongs to fbi agent frank lacrosse ( dennis quaid ) , and that the kidnapper/killer is a nameless fiend that lacrosse has been tracking across the country for quite a while .  he is promptly removed from the case , but this conflict of interest doesn't keep him from offering pursuit .  lacrosse's most recent trek takes him to a blood-soaked hotel room in amarillo , texas , where the local sheriff ( r . lee ermey ) is torn between his re-election campaign and helping his new ally catch his man .  in a related aside , former railway worker bob goodall ( danny glover ) is cruising through the snowbound west in his pinup-plastered ( even on the seatbelts ) el dorado .  along the way , he picks up -- and subsequently saves the life of -- hitchhiking loner lane dixon ( jared leto ) .  this tangent isn't a random one , as bob or lane will end up either holding a piece of the puzzle or turn out to be the killer himself .  or is the villain in fact lacrosse , only pretending to be after the cold-hearted murderer he knows so much about .  in a sense , that's half of the basic problem with " switchback . "  for its first hour , the movie presents evidence that any of these three men could be the perpetrator , so we're given little insight into who they are , likely for fear that we'll learn too much too fast and therefore be able to make the proper deduction .  but " switchback " then decides to explicitly reveal the killer's identity at its midpoint , and the following contradictory character motivations muddle both the pacing and the generation of suspense .  some of the acting is a burdensome area as well , probably because the performers were instructed to build personas that are the exact opposite of their true selves .  what is danny glover doing here , grinning and yeehawing his way through the messy plot ?  and dennis quaid ?   ( that monotone -- stop it ! )  ermey is solid in a supporting role that's more interesting than the two leads thrown together , but the charismatic leto ( claire danes' object of affection in " my so-called life " ) is a scene-stealer tried and true .  >from a material standpoint , " switchback " is pretty empty .  but even when first-time director jeb stuart ( who wrote " the fugitive " and " die hard " ) doesn't know what to do , he knows what he wants it to look like -- the movie provides some great visuals .  the set-on-a-train climax looks good ( even though the action is illogical ) , and the beautiful , crisp cinematography captures the rockies in all of their icy splendor .  still , that's not enough to turn a lump of coal into a diamond , and more than the movie's look will end up leaving you cold . 
pos@ pos neg every once in a while , a film sneaks up on me and takes me completely by surprise .  i don't necessarily mean in terms of quality ; rather , i'm referring to the mere knowledge of its existence .  usually i know what films are on the way a year in advance , but two weeks ago i had never heard of princess caraboo .  it has slipped rather quietly into limited release , and appears destined to slip out just as quietly .  that's a shame , because princess caraboo is a delightful fable , romantic , gentle and very appealing .  what's more , it's surprisingly insightful and provides a sharp-witted lesson in english social history .  princess caraboo is based on an actual event in early 19th century england , involving a young woman ( phoebe cates ) who is found wandering the countryside .  apparently unable to speak any english , she is taken in by good-hearted gentlewoman mrs . worrall ( wendy hughes ) .  her banker husband ( jim broadbent ) is none-too-pleased about this strange houseguest , until the worralls begin to believe that the woman may be royalty from an east indian island , the princess caraboo .  this development inspires plans for a lucrative trading venture for mr . worrall , and an introduction into elite social circles for mrs . worrall .  however , local journalist john gutch ( stephen rea ) is not convinced that the woman is what she seems to be , and sets out to find out the truth about princess caraboo .  as a social satire and comedy of manners , princess caraboo is a winner .  it takes place in an era when it was common practice in england to jail vagrants and hang beggars , and that practice comes in for an obvious hazing .  but it is handled most effectively through the character of mr . worrall , a drunken womanizer whose bank is in deep trouble thanks to his corruption and ineptitude .  he is worse than one of the idle rich ; he is one of the actively odious gentry so eager to distance themselves from the lower class they think nothing of simply eliminating them , and since the house and money are all from mrs . worrall , he is a bit too close to them for comfort .  while hypocrisy is an easy target for ridicule , director and co-writer michael austin keeps the treatment too light-hearted to be heavy-handed .  he also takes a unique stab at the trendiness of the upper classes , as the princess becomes a " sensation " at court .  in one of the film's best sequences , princess caraboo is the guest of honor at a party hosted by the prince regent ( a wonderfully foppish turn by comic john sessions ) , and the lords and ladies end up following her around in a thoroughly silly native dance .  it is then that princess caraboo shows how easily people are swept up in " sensations , " an idea that takes on a timeless quality ( and makes the film an interesting companion piece to the current quiz show ) .  social commentary aside , princess caraboo is simply an eminently enjoyable entertainment .  the performers are mostly delightful , particularly phoebe cates , who is radiant in a part that requires a gift for pantomime .  her supporting players are also appealing : wendy hughes as the patient and kindly mrs . worrall ; kevin kline as frixos , the worralls' suspicious and superior greek butler ; stephen rea as the world-weary but ultimately romantic gutch .  only john lithgow is a disappointment , turning in a limp performance as a scholar who attempts to verify the princess's identity .  the story twists and turns just enough so that the question of whether or not the princess is really a princess is always in some doubt , without becoming gimmicky .  it is unfortunate that the growing attraction between gutch and princess caraboo isn't given more time to develop , because the potential seemed to be there .  when it finally does blossom , it seems too quick to be plausible .  princess caraboo is patient enough in establishing its sense of time and place that it might seem a bit slow to viewers seeking a fantasy romp .  still , it has both escapist and intellectual appeal , and is well worth seeking out .  it is the kind of film that makes my job its most rewarding--a hidden gem . 
neg@ pos neg a life less ordinary ( r ) while the extremely peculiar a life less ordinary does live up to its title , a more appropriate moniker would be a movie more misguided , for this confused , confusing attempt at romantic comedy is a most disarming disaster from the talented trainspotting team of director danny boyle , producer andrew macdonald , and screenwriter john hodge .  at the core of this strange film is a fairly basic--and , yes , ordinary--premise .  after robert ( boyle regular ewan mcgregor ) , an aspiring writer of trashy novels , is fired from his janitorial job at the naville corporation , he kidnaps naville's ( ian holm ) spoiled daughter celine ( cameron diaz ) and holds her for ransom .  the joke here is that celine is a willing victim--her father threatened to cut her off financially , so she wants revenge--and that she soon becomes not only an accomplice but the brains behind the scheme , teaching the inept robert a thing or two about kidnapping . . .  and , ultimately ( didn't we see this one coming ? ) ,  love .  so far , so mediocre .  but mediocre is better than dreadful , which this film is , thanks in no small part to the hodge's contextual frame for the romance .  it turns out that god is displeased with the divorce and romantic breakup rate on earth , so the chief of heaven's police , gabriel ( dan hedaya ) dispatches two angels , o'reilly ( holly hunter ) and jackson ( delroy lindo ) , to earth to hook up celine and robert--or lose their angel status .  this conceit might have worked if the angel dimension played an integral role in the entire picture .  but it could have easily been cut without any clear loss to the film ; as it stands , it is simply a waste of time that distracts from the romance at hand .  not that there is much of a romance to begin with .  try as diaz and mcgregor may , celine and robert are too one-note to become very endearing characters .  celine is rich bitch ; robert is a dullard .  as such , it is quite hard for the audience to really connect with these two--then again , they never seem to really connect with each other .  when celine and robert start to overtly act on their " feelings , " it comes off more like something scripted than anything natural .  but i am not exactly sure if boyle and company's point was romance ; honestly , i am not exactly sure what they were trying to accomplish .  boyle juices up the visuals with his characteristic razzmatazz , but it remains just that--energy , not energy in service of a story or even acting .  the cast seems lost , especially hunter , whose performance is so adrift as to be baffling .  and then there are the many eccentricities splattered onto the film : some violent confrontations involving the angels , who are not exactly angelic--in fact , they end up staging their own ransom scheme ; some mystical hokum in the climax ; and a cutesy claymation epilogue .  watching much of a life less ordinary is like being trapped in indie hipster hell , stockpiling quirks in the name of cool .  instead , the film just gives quirky a bad name .  my best guess as to what the filmmakers wanted to accomplish is an atmosphere of warped womantic ( yes , misspelling intended ) whimsy , which comes through in only one scene : an extended musical number where celine and robert sing " beyond the sea " at a karaoke bar .  after a verse or two , the couple are magically dolled up in snazzy outfits and hairdos , and engage in a spirited dance routine on the counter .  the scene works not only because of its relative simplicity but also because it does not try too hard , just relying on the innate charm of the leads , allowing them to build a romantic rapport .  alas , not nearly enough is built , for this moment comes to an abrupt end .  i applaud any attempt to bring something fresh and unique to movie houses , but sometimes even cleverness can reach overkill .  a life less ordinary certainly delivers something " different , " but by the time the film was over , i was clamoring for a life more ordinary .   " i can accept failure .  everyone fails at something .  but i can't accept not trying .  it doesn't matter if you win as long as you give everything in your heart . "  --michael jordan

"  the incredibly pale , red-headed scottish actress swinton immerses herself into the role of the reserved american super-mom whose life revolves around serving the needs of her three children and live-in father-in-law jack ( peter donat , " the game " ) .  she shows great strength while allowing other emotions to glimmer through - discomfort at challenging reese in his gay disco ( named the deep end ) , near panic at having to dive down to his body to retrieve car keys , or even wry humor when an attempt to get help from jack becomes hopelessly miscommunicated .  gradually her loneliness becomes apparent ( her husband's a naval officer , usually away at sea ) when her attempts to email him her concerns about beau are deleted and later , when a most unusual , yet chaste , romance turns tragic .  it's a terrific performance .  the stendahl syndrome-like script , adapted from elisabeth sanxay holding's 40's noir novel 'the blank wall' by directors scott mcgehee and david siegel , would be unbelievable if not for swinton and her costar visnjic .  alek spera is a wrong side of the tracks loser who arrives after reese's body has been discovered .  he shows margaret a videotape of beau having sex with reese and demands $50 , 000 or he'll turn the tape over to the reno police .  subsequent visits will turn his mind set upside down and backwards , though , as he comes to admire and even love the woman he set out to blackmail .  there's yet another problem , though - his partner nagle ( raymond barry , " dead man walking " ) is a harder cored criminal who won't let up until his share of the money is delivered .  visnjic's dark , brooding turn has an interior shading to it that makes us believe he's a victim of circumstance and environment .  his turnaround is palpable as he witnesses margaret's inherent decency and her workaday surroundings .  also outstanding is tucker as beau , who has a terrific character arc and pas de deux with his mother .  initially beau's the typical sullen teen .

neg@ pos neg starring ben stiller , elizabeth hurley , maria bello , janeane garofalo screenplay by david veloz , based on the novel by jerry stahl directed by david veloz  permanent midnight is a pretty bad movie , though it took me a few days to conclude this .  the film is more masturbatory than bleak , with its main character intent on confounding us with his stupidity .   ( he has a $6000 a week drug habit . )  ultimately , as adapted by veloz , jerry stahl comes off as one of those playground braggarts who chainsmokes at the age of twelve ; you are less mystified by his self-destructive nature than bored into a stupor yourself .  ben stiller plays stahl , a young author who arrives in l . a . with ambition and a nasty drug habit .  he eventually gets a gig for $5000/week writing for a sitcom called mr . chompers ( a thinly veiled stand-in for " alf " : chompers looks just like alf except he's blue ) , marries a producer ( hurley ) so she can get a green card , and hooks up with a spanish mother ( liz torres ) , who shoots heroin with him in the afternoons .  insert proverbial downward spiral here .  permanent midnight is structured mostly as a flashback , with recovering addict bello meeting stiller ( at a fastfood restaurant , where stiller works the drive-thru as part of rehab ) , taking him back to a hotel , and between bouts of serious screwing , listening to his life story .  i've spent the last week trying to figure out why stiller never seemed to find the frighteningly gorgeous hurley attractive-worse , i've been trying to figure out why hurley did find stiller attractive .  as stahl , stiller displays none of the charm or wit one would expect ( post-there's something about mary ) of either the actor or a comedy writer .  what separates stahl from the hundreds of other hollywood punk-junkies , it seems , is that stahl wrote a book about his idiocy .  watch stahl shoot heroin next to a baby !  watch stahl spoil numerous pitch meetings with smack-fueled babble !  stiller gives a technically flawless performance : the film could double as a documentary on how to be a junkie .  but permanent midnight is mostly soulless .  when the movie poses the question will stahl be saved ?  and then answers it in the form of bello's character ( basically a shrink in black panties ) , could a person care less ?  in the film version of his autobiography of the same name , stahl doesn't need saving , he needs someone who will sit there and listen to him go on about himself .  if you learn anything about the other characters in this movie , it's that they are the most incredibly tolerant hollywood-types known to man .   ( stahl also seems to be the only person at schmooze parties doing drugs .  is this hollywood . . . california ? )  i learned very little about the entertainment business from permanent midnight and a whole lot about an egotistical lunkhead .  of course you know that stahl triumphed because he lived to talk about his problems .  so , basically , his drug habit got him a book deal , a movie based on his life , and now he's apparently collaborating with stiller on future projects .  so much for the moral of that story .  temporary midnight is more like it .  -bill chambers ; september , 1998 
pos@ pos neg as i write the review for the new hanks/ryan romantic comedy you've got mail , i am acutely aware that i am typing it on a computer and sending it a billion miles away on the internet .  i am also aware that i have just spent the last 2 hours watching the world's biggest paid commercial for america online .  and i wonder : is that so bad ?  well , the commercial part is .  as for the movie , well , as long as i can watch tom hanks and meg ryan , i think i'll be okay .  to paraphrase james berardinelli , whose reviews i admire very much , tom hanks and meg ryan can act .  they are both wonderful , but for all of hanks' glorious work in serious films , such as his magnificent performance in saving private ryan , and his glorious triumph in philadelphia , i like him best when he's suitably obnoxious .  tom hanks is wonderful when he is obnoxious in a romantic comedy when he's going to get the girl : the only question is how ?  meg ryan , america's high school sweetheart , can act .  she's had a handful of memorable performances , including the great scene in the diner in when harry met sally ( i must not mention what she does , due to the , well , um , you get the idea , and if you don't , get the movie-- fantastic ) .  but , i like her best when she's , well , perky .  she is so adorably perky/cute that together with hanks , they are the most amazing onscreen duo in my short lifetime .  some people have them going back to really old classic romantic couples , but i don't really know .  all i know is that i just like them both .  they have such wonderfully kinetic chemistry that's really hard to resist , and i'm not going to even try .  they're just really , really cute , sweet , and charming .  hanks and ryan collaborate once again with nora ephron , who directed them in the megahit sleepless in seattle .  here , the setup is a little different .  kathleen kelly ( ryan ) owns a small children's bookstore which her mother founded 42 years ago and passed down to her .  she is successful , beautiful , and dates a well-known columnist with very radical idea ( kinnear ) .  she is also having an affair , of sorts .  you see , kathleen , with the handle shopgirl , is secretly emailing ny152 .  they have a strictly un-detailed relationship : there are no specifics , and they have no idea who each other is .  ny152 happens to be joe fox ( hanks ) , a multimillionaire bookseller who is the heir to the fortune of the fox chain of mega-bookstores , run by his father ( coleman ) .  fox books has decided to open a store on the west side , right across from a little children's bookseller named " shop around the corner " , run by a perky girl named kathleen kelly .  every morning , these two email each other silly , and every day , they fight " to the death ! ! " .  it's a charming premise , and one that works nicely , balancing the immense troubles kathleen is in with the romance she wants to have .  it also has the great sense of being a classic romance : there is no " let's have sex tonight " mantra , if you'll excuse my bluntness .  this is a solid romance built around that vague concept of love .  hmm . well , the movie goes through twists and turns , having some sad moments and happy ones , until at one moment tom hanks and meg ryan " hook up " , to use modern terminology , and kiss their way into happiness .  you know it's going to happen , the question is now ?  thankfully , ephron has a wonderful supporting cast with posey , kinnear , chappelle , and a host of others , including a great scene involving brothers , aunts , and two sweet kids .  it's all cute and wonderful , and for all of the idealism , it makes me feel good .  hanks is as obnoxious as ever on the outside and as warm on the inside as he always is .  he is , i believe , america's greatest actor .  does he show it here ?  nah .  but he's still tom hanks , and she's still meg ryan .  which is what this movie boils down to .  it's pure confection .  all the bits about the godfather , the jokes , the superb script , it's all really sweet .  there are some immense flaws , like pacing .  the last third of the movie really doesn't work as well as i would have liked , and for a romantic comedy , it's slow .  once hanks knows the secret , it gets really slow .  i even looked at my watch a couple times , to make sure ephron was going to deliver the big onscreen kiss i was waiting for , so that i could get home at a reasonable hour .  the other problem is that this movie is shaping up to be really dated .  e-mail ?  when my kids are my age , i don't know what we'll be using .  but hanks can do more with one eyeroll than anybody , and meg ryan just loves to dive into a pillow better than anyone in movie history .  they just work together , and it's nice to see .  it gives you , well , a smile .  the script helps with some great lines that are absolutely hilarious , and that always come at the exact right time to keep the audience awake .  i was arguing with my father on the drive back home on what the purpose of movies was .  i've always believed that movies are very powerful , very powerful indeed .  you see , mankind has three abilities he needs to survive : the ability to think , entertain , and procreate .  movies can definitely do the first two , and as for the third , well , i'd rather not think about that .  i always thought films that made you think enlightened you and made you see something from another viewpoint , and that films that entertained you were good , because you forgot about your troubles and thought about something nice for a night .  and i was thinking about how incredible a year tom hanks has had .  hanks was the driving force behind one of the year's best films in saving private ryan , which is one of those thinking films that truly made someone wonder about the world .  he's also half of the glue behind the year's best example of pure entertainment .  tom hanks and meg ryan are magical , as is this movie .  it's a sweet , lovely affair with a technology twist .  it may be a long commercial , but it gave me a pretty big smile on my face . 
neg@ pos neg capsule : the running gag pair of characters from all of kevin smith's films gets their own movie .  the gags are sporadically funny .  it is more than occasionally funny for teens who are fond of scatological humor and anti-gay jokes .  the plot is weak and the leads are not a particularly funny comic team .  the little inside jokes and digs at other entertainment and particularly at kevin smith films are the best features of the film .  sadly for me they were just not funny enough to make the film worth watching .  this feels like the high school skit that that the principal would not let the kids do on talent night .   ( and it turns out he had very good reasons . )   , low 0 ( -4 to +4 )  a film needs a plot .  it needs characters for empathy value .  it needs a story and an emotional center .  if a film is just a chain of jokes it can only be so good and any entertainment value will succeed or fail based on how funny the jokes are .  kevin smith has now made two satisfying films , clerks and chasing amy .  with dogma he tried to make a philosophical religious comedy and mixed with a madcap romp .  peter cook and dudley moore did that very successfully with their bedazzled .  but getting the combination to work is very hard to do right and kevin smith's fecal monsters in dogma were not the way to do it .  his remaining two films , mallrats and his new jay and silent bob strike back are aimed squarely at a teenage audience .  jay and silent bob strike back is a compendium of gay jokes , penis jokes , flatulence jokes , film pastiches , and in-jokes .  how funny the jokes are will be a subjective call .  for me , the vast majority of the jokes were just not very funny .  there was not enough cleverness or variety .  it is funny at most once or twice to accuse someone of being gay .  penis jokes work only so many times .  showing up as minor characters in every kevin smith film jay and silent bob were a clever pair of human running gags .  they were sort of the modern equivalents of naunton wayne and basil radford , the comic duo who showed up satirizing the english middle class in several good british post-war films including dead of night , the lady vanishes , and passport to pimlico .  jay and silent bob were originally supposedly typical generation x stoners .  as the series wore on they had larger and larger parts .  in jay and silent bob strike back they are the leads .  jay and silent bob ( played by jason mewes and kevin smith ) are chased away from the front of the convenience store where they were dealing drugs in clerks .  this leaves them at loose ends .  they are not sure what would be worthwhile to do with their lives when they hear that a comic book with characters visually modeled on them will be adapted into a movie .  they decide to devote their lives to wrecking the movie or getting some of that big movie industry cash .  so it is off to hollywood to shake down the movie company and having adventures along the way .  the film is mostly about their adventures on the road and when they get to hollywood  the problem with this comedy team is that neither really pulls his weight to make the film funny .  silent bob , being silent , can only contribute to the comedy by reacting with that very expressive face of his .  this makes his piece of the comedy even less than a straight man like a dean martin or bud abbott would have .  jay has to be the comic .  he could carry the load for both if he were extremely inventive .  the problem is that he is not sufficiently funny .  he is too bland to be the comic half and his lines just do not show any comic flair .  so jay and silent bob are a long way from being a successful comic team .  their starring roles and the low humor make this a comedy for those young at mind and for people who can laugh at gags they have seen before--sometimes just minutes before .  like dogma before it , but definitely not like chasing amy , this film feels more like an amateurish skit than a real movie .  certainly neither the plot nor the characters are at all involving .  they are excuses for gags , many of which still fall flat .  it is dogma without any of the humorous theological content .  the film does not offer much to an adult audience .  i rate it 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .

" ) .  and i dare you to get his " monkey " photo shoot out of your head after seeing this movie ( " you're a monkey , derek . . . a  monkey ! " )  i also really liked the soundtrack and the pace of the film , both of which zipped and zagged , and established a nice rhythm to it all .  again , it's to note that this movie is dumb and not for everyone , but my guess is that if you laughed at the trailer , you will likely enjoy many of the quips in the actual picture as well .  if you thought the trailer was dumb , skip this dodo bird and go rent austin powers again or something , a film from which there is an obvious influence here .  blue steel , baby . . . yeah ! ! !  where's joblo coming from ?  austin powers ( 7/10 ) - austin powers 2 ( 7/10 ) - deuce bigalow ( 7/10 ) - dude , where's my car ( 7/10 ) - freddy got fingered ( 5/10 ) - jay & silent bob strike back ( 8/10 ) - joe dirt ( 5/10 ) - meet the parents ( 8/10 ) - say it isn't so ( 3/10 ) 
neg@ pos neg it's probably inevitable that the popular virtual reality genre ( " the matrix , " " existenz " ) would collide with the even more popular serial-killer genre ( " kiss the girls , " " se7en " ) .  the result should have been more interesting than " the cell . "  as the movie opens , therapist catharine deane ( jennifer lopez ) treats a catatonic boy ( colton james ) by entering his mind through some sort of virtual reality technique that's never fully explained .  after months of therapy sessions in a surreal desert , catharine has no success to report .  meanwhile , killer carl stargher ( vincent d'onofrio ) has claimed another victim .  his particular hobby is to kidnap young women , keep them in a glass cell overnight , and drown them .  he takes the corpse and soaks it in bleach , then suspends himself over the body and jerks off while watching a video tape of the drowning .  although carl's been doing this for awhile , he's recently become sloppy , and fbi agent peter novak ( vince vaughn ) is closing in fast .  not fast enough , though , to keep carl from sticking another woman ( tara subkoff ) in the cell or to catch him before he suffers a schizophrenic attack that leaves him in a coma .  from the videos in carl's house , peter can see that the drowning cell is automated and will fill with water forty hours after the abduction .  to save the kidnapped girl , peter has to find the cell before the end of the day , and comatose carl's not talking .  so off they go to catharine in the hope that she can go inside carl's mind and find out where the cell is in time .  the focus of " the cell " in on the ornate interior of carl's mind , but the universe director tarsem singh creates seems more an exercise in computer-generated spectacle than an exploration of the psychotic personality .  for the most part , it's style without substance .  in his own mind , carl is a decadent emperor in flowing robes , ming the merciless , as well as a frightened boy ( jake thomas ) abused by his father .  all in all , the mind of a psycho killer turns out to be a strangely dull place , and i kept wishing i could fast-forward to the next development .  singh is best known for directing music videos , particularly rem's " losing my religion , " and " the cell " seems very much like a really long , really slow mtv video with the sound deleted .  singer lopez seems to think she's in a video as well ; she devotes more time to posing in elaborate costumes than she does to acting .  the premise had great promise .  the computer-generated world within carl's mind could have been a bizarre , surreal universe governed by insanity and symbolism rather than logic .  the first room catharine enters in carl's head shows this promise .  she finds a horse standing in center of the room ; suddenly , sheets of sharp-edged glass fall into the horse , dividing it into segments .  the panes of glass separate , pulling apart the pieces of the still-living horse .  this scene is twisted , disturbing , and thought-provoking , because the psychological importance of the horse and its fate is left to the viewer to ponder .  another element that should have been developed is the effect on catharine of merging with the mind of a psychopath .  their minds begin to bleed together at one point in the movie , and this should have provided an opportunity to discover the dark corners of catharine's own psyche .  like sidney lumet's " the offence " or michael mann's " manhunter , " " the cell " could have explored how the madness of the killer brings out a repressed darkness in the investigator .  however , catharine's character is hardly developed at all , and lopez has no depth to offer the role .  bottom line : don't get trapped in this one . 
pos@ pos neg  * * * * * * minor plot spoilers in review * * * * * * * * * * * * no major spoilers are in review * * * * * *  the previous two " alien " films have each had their own unique styles to them .  the ridley scott's alien was very much a stylistic suspense film .  james cameron's aliens was much more of an action film .  and i liked each film separately for which it was .  now alien 3 is out .  and it is it's own film in the same right that alien and aliens were .  unlike aliens , alien 3 requires that you have seen aliens .  this is very important as the story picks up exactly were aliens left off .  the survivors of the expedition to lv-426 are returning home after battling and beating the aliens .  the climactic fight scene between ripley and the mother alien on the sulaco in aliens left behind one item , an egg .  in the opening sequence we see the egg hatch , find its quarry , which leads to a fire aboard the sulaco when the facehugger is injured , an leads the sulaco to jettison the hypersleep tubes in an escape vessel .  this vessel crash lands on fury 109 .  everyone in the vessel is killed , except ripley .  the facehugger is jettisoned with them and survives the crash .  fury 109 is an ex-mining/maximum security prison .  when closed down , some of the lifer prisoners decided to stay and live out the remaining years on the planet .  all the prisoners are men who have not seen a woman in many years .  ripley's arrival sparks a problem with the inmates .  as for the new haircut that ripley and the prisoner's sport , there is an infestation of lice on the planet .  being an ex-prison means that there is no way off the planet and no weapons .  so the prisoners and ripley are off to face the alien on their own .  i will not go into detail , but you can guess what happens here .  the alien is loose and no one believes ripley's outstanding story .  she finds comfort in the arms of the colony's doctor .  yes , after 57 years ripley has sex .  it is not gratuitous , in fact , we don't even see them kiss , but it is just as well .  a sweaty sex scene would not have worked in the context of the film .  there is a lot more gore in alien 3 .  in fact i would guess to say that there is more in alien 3 than either of the earlier two .  it also sports a new alien with 4 legs !  i won't say how , but it leads us to believe a few new things about the alien and its cycle , which i am sure will be explored in alien 4 .  sigourney weaver is back as ripley and provides another excellent performance of this character .  her scene during the autopsy of newt is enough to garnish her another academy nomination .  the rest of the cast is also quite good .  notably , charles dance as the doctor with whom ripley finds momentary escape from fury 109 .  alien 3 has a very distinct look .  this is due largely to its director , david fincher .  mr . fincher , who until now has only directed music videos and commercials , has done an incredible job here .  his direction is excellent and makes this film come to life in ways no " alien " film has before .  for mr . fincher , i see a long prosperous career ahead of him .  the music was also done by a newcomer to the film industry .  elliot goldenthal has created a deeply moving score which lends itself to the claustrophobic setting that the " alien " series been set in .  this time the score is not so much a rip off of star trek ii ( james horner's aliens ) .  this score has a choral back up at times and even lends itself to the old style of ennio morricone scoring .  this is a great score .  the ending to alien 3 is quite good .  there were times i thought that hollywood would come in and screw it up , but it played very nicely .  i will not ruin the ending for you .  go see the film .  i consider it to be a much more involved film than any of the other films released so far this season .  alien 3 is a worthy successor to aliens and alien .  and when they make alien 4 , perhaps they will be able to find yet another new direction to take it in . 
neg@ pos neg movies based on video games , such as street fighter or mario bros . , have never generated much interest at the box office .  but when the first mortal kombat movie came out in 1995 , it did surprisingly well .  with a simple story , a pulsating soundtrack , and lots of awesomely choreographed fight scenes , the movie moved quickly and displayed lots of energy .  it got my vote for 'the movie where i expected the least and got the most' .  and , if you haven't had the opportunity , i would definitely recommend that you see it on video .  in the world of mortal kombat , based on the popular arcade game , dark forces from outworld try to infiltrate earth's realm with the ulimate goal of total conquest and the destruction of humanity .  the mortal kombat refers to a competition , fought by human mortals against outworld's minions , which if won , will guarantee earth's safety for another generation .  mk2 picks up almost immediately after the humans return victoriously from competition .  despite their victory , however , a gateway has somehow opened , and outworld continues in its quest to conquer earth .  outworld's warriors include an impressive collection of fighters , including shao kahn , mintoro ( a centaur ) , sheeva ( a four-armed ogre ) , and sindel .  earth's mortal warriors , under the leadership of the benevolent god , lord rayden , includes liu kang , princess kitana , sonya blade and jax , who must fight against outworld's forces .  it's an easy enough premise , but unfortunately ( very unfortunately ) , the writers try to do too much with the movie .  it is only a video game , after all , but the on-screen version tries to go beyond it's comic book boundaries by adding depth , a conceptualization of self-worth , and worst of all , a love story .  this becomes very awkward , because all of the players are fighters and nothing more .  they are likable and impressive when they are showcasing their martial arts and fighting skills , but look extremely awkward and uncomfortable when they are required to actually act .  this becomes embarrassingly apparent , for example , as the movie tries to develop a romantic bond between liu kang and princess kitana .  the original mk was smart in letting the players do what they do best .  they spoke little , but fought a lot .  thus , the movie was easy to digest .  however , mk2 tries to give these players a certain amount of depth , an element that was lacking in the first movie , but the attempt here fails miserably .  this uneasy feeling is readily apparent , for example , whenever you hear lord rayden speak .  not only does he talk in riddles and offer enigmatic ( e . g .  useless ) advice , but he speaks so slowly as if to simulate infinite wisdom .  try reading this half as fast , and you'll hear what i mean .  but the movie is not a complete fatality .  fight scenes are well-choreographed , highlighted by terrific acrobatics and agility .  and players of the game will be rewarded with the inclusion of practically every character from the video game , although their screen time amounts to nothing more than a cameo .  even if you're not familiar with the video game , each fighter has their own costume and unique weaponry to easily differentiate themselves .  but it's just too little of what movie-goers and especially fans of the game will expect .  oddly , the inclusion of the human element actually pollutes the purity of the mortal kombat essence .  and the poor acting results in a muddled movie that offers the viewing audience little chance for survival .   ( i am now talking very slowly as if to simulate infinite wisdom ) .  rent the first one , but the sequel is for kombat fans only . 
pos@ pos neg on re-watching italian writer/director dario argento's much lauded murder mystery tenebrae , i was struck more than anything else by how many sins he commits as a storyteller and manages to get away with .  in emphasising style over matters of plot argento is somewhat notorious in cult film circles , but some aficionados still praise tenebrae as the greatest of his " giallo " murder mysteries .  while it's certainly not perfect , repeated viewings reveal it to be nonetheless a densely plotted and terrifically stylish thriller .  the story follows a promotional visit to rome by famous american mystery novelist peter neal ( anthony franciosa ) where he discovers that a serial killer is on the loose inspired by his latest book " tenebrae " .  with the police on his back for leads , he decides to take a personal interest in the case and he soon becomes drawn into a mystery where all is not as it seems .  the film benefits enormously from a fine central performance by franciosa .  he brings grace , charm and a deceptive benigness to his character which provides an interesting foil to both the violence of the books he writes and the unfolding real-life horror around him .  the film is awash with a fascinating psychosexual tension .  argento peels back the facade of showbiz and jetset lifestyles to reveal an amoral , ambivalent , shadowy world where desire in all its forms has become a dangerous business .  tenebrae is perhaps the most multi-layered of argento's scripts to date and there is much bubbling underneath the surface here .  it may take at least two or three viewings to appreciate all the psychological themes at play .  in that respect it strongly recalls his previous giallo deep red/profondo rosso ( the full-length italian language version ) and fans will enjoy spotting the recurring themes .  needless to say for argento fans , there is no denying the director's brilliance as a stylist .  many of the action and murder sequences are directed with his characteristic finesse and feature plenty of intriguing camerawork .  they are all the more impressive for the fact that in this film argento creates mood by filling his scenes with light , rather than the dark shadows and deep rich colours of earlier works like deep red and suspiria .  instead , tenebrae's set design and lighting paints a sleek , clinical , chilly vision of a vaguely futuristic urban world .  and the soundtrack's mix of electronic atmospheres and gothic rock by frequent argento collaborators goblin is the perfect accompaniment .  so tenebrae has much to recommend it , no question .  still , constantly nagging at the back of this viewers mind is several lumps in the narrative .  some critics argue that logic doesn't matter in argento films , but damnit , it matters in all films to the point where viewers don't deserve to feel cheated .  by the way , if you don't want to know the solution to the mystery then skip the next three paragraphs .  about an hour into tenebrae the story takes an unexpected twist which , properly handled , could have proved ingenious .  we witness the murder of the serial killer himself by a man who , we later discover , is none other than the author peter neal .  he is insane , apparently .  the murders then continue for the remainder of the film as neal decides it's time to settle some personal business involving his neurotic wife .  he is finally revealed to us as this " second killer " in the film's bloody climax .  but argento muffs the twist , both technically and narratively .  you see , we are supposed to be tricked into thinking that during this scene peter neal is actually an innocent witness who was crouching in the bushes nearby the whole time and spying on the killer's house .  but thanks to poor editing , its had to believe neal could have murdered the killer anyway .  bad cutting puts the timing way out .  in other words , he's almost in two places at once .  during this crucial scene we are also thrown a ridiculous red herring .  by the film's end you realise that for the sake of an alibi neal must have self-inflicted a nasty injury in this earlier scene to make it look like he was attacked by a fleeing assailant .  the injury ?  he banged himself on the head with a bloody great rock !  thus , the revelation of the " hero " as a killer ( and anti-hero ) in the final scenes may still prove shocking , but its all somewhat implausible by the time the end credits have rolled .  helpfully , in the end we do learn that the bizarre flashbacks of personal humiliation and murder that have permeated the film belonged to neal all along .  but there too is a problem , as the explanations offered for his motivations are psychologically fuzzy to say the least .  the story owes us a better understanding of franciosa's mind , his concealed madness and his sudden murderous rampage .  tenebrae is also marred by annoying little inconsistencies .  for instance , a teenage boy and girl leave a hotel room and minutes later we see the girl riding off on the back of a motorbike .  we would assume the rider is the same boy , but it turns out to be some male character we aren't even introduced too !  that's careless filmmaking , pure and simple .  why , you may ask , do i go on about the story's flaws ?  because when it comes to visuals and set pieces , argento is one of the most exciting filmmakers in the world .  take one of the extended scenes in tenebrae .  an upset girl wandering the streets at night needlessly taunts a guard dog to the point where - almost unbelievably - it jumps a high fence and chases her across town .  finally , as she desperately seeks escape from this crazed canine , she accidentally stumbles on the serial killer's lair .  it's an absolutely masterful sequence , tense and exciting , and communicating a wealth of information through visuals alone .  and that's exactly the kind of thing that makes the flaws so frustrating .  too often , it seems , argento's films as a whole are less than the sum of their impressive parts .  mind you , if you love murder mysteries then tenebrae is still worth a look .  and if you're a fan of argento's unique style of giallo thriller then it's essential .  see the uncut widescreen version if you can and drink in some of the wonderful cinematography by luciano tovoli .  it's a stylish , great-looking and quirky film despite the problem narrative .  a shame , because it doesn't have to be that way .  take argento's more recent stendhal syndrome ( 1992 ) , where with the aid of co-writer franco ferrini he fashioned a solid storyline without sacrificing any of his surreal weirdness or visual panache .  proof that he can do it , if he tries . . . 
neg@ pos neg this is the first film in what would become the most successful series of horror films of all time .  a fair warning to those of you who might be inclined to watch this movie for the first appearance of everyone's favorite goalie-mask-wearing homicidal maniac .  jason , the guy who single handedly controlled the overpopulation problem around the crystal lake area , doesn't start his quest to find the most interesting household item with which to kill someone until the sequel .  while he does have a small role in this film , we the audience have to depend on another blood thirsty maniac to rack up the body count .  the plot , like every other friday the 13th movie goes something like this -- crazed killer murders as many unsuspecting teenagers as he/she/it possibly can in the space of a 90 minute movie .  the reasons that the afore mentioned unsuspecting teenagers come into contact with the bloodthirsty killer are usually of little importance to the story .  but for those of you out there that might actually care about such trivial matters in a movie such as a plot , here are the basics .  a bunch of unsuspecting teens get a summer job at a long closed summer camp .  they are days away from the arrival of the kids and they are spending their time fixing the place up and making sure it is ready for the kids .  sadly , they start being butchered one by one by the bloodthirsty killer .  at this point i would usually say something about the quality of acting , directing or maybe something about the high quality of the production .  since i'm not going to do that , feel free to assume that if i did , it wouldn't be positive .  i will say that this movie looks as if it was made for about a hundred bucks , and that includes the actors' salaries .  if you are used to recent horror films like scream , you are in for a bit of a surprise .  the only saving grace for friday the 13th is that it was really the first of its kind , with the killer taking real pride in their work .  using as many methods of murder as they could .  none of this single murder weapon stuff life that unimaginative leatherface in chainsaw massacre , or the creatively stifled imagination of halloween's michael myers who just used brute force or a really big kitchen knife .  nope , in the friday the 13th movies , you can always count on the killer taking great pride in his work .  one fun fact about this movie is that the cast includes a very young kevin bacon , although after this movie it is a wonder he ever worked again .  the main reason to see friday the 13th is if you want to watch all of the series from the beginning .  if not , stick with the later films with jason , everyone's favorite hockey fan .  friday the 13th is the sort of movie that is fun to sit down and get a couple of scares from , just don't sit down expecting a whole lot . 
pos@ pos neg a cinematic version of one of john irving's novels is always cause for celebration even if , as in the case of " simon birch , " the treatment is merely " suggested by , " rather than strictly based on , the book .  suggested means that irving , author of the acclaimed " the world according to garp , " sold the rights to his novel " a prayer for owen meany " to the disney machine for $1 million , but wouldn't grant them permission to use either the title or any of the character names .  that's an odd decision--irving claims it's to protect both himself and the novel--but it's one that doesn't unduly harm the finished product .  irving's books are rich and complex works , full of intriguing , colorful characters .   " a prayer for owen meany " is no exception ; it tells the story of an unusual boy--called simon birch in the film version--who is uncommonly small in stature and possesses a high-pitched falsetto voice , " like strangled mice . "  simon believes himself to be " god's instrument , " placed on this earth to somehow effect god's plan .  simon is played by ian michael smith , who suffers from a rare enzyme disorder known as morquio syndrome which , among other things , prevents bones , ligaments , and joints from developing normally .  smith's debilitating disease makes him an obvious physical choice for " simon birch " ; however , the producers unwisely favored form over function--smith's acting abilities are limited at best .  another drawback is that in the book , simon's condition is described the way irving describes any of his characters--in careful , loving detail .  watching " simon birch , " however , creates a different feeling altogether ; the audience is forced into a voyeuristic relationship with the character , surely something irving would not have intended .  simon himself tends to be too cute and irritating , a combination of smith's rookie status as an actor and the precocious one-liners he's forced to deliver , courtesy mark steven johnson , the film's director and screenwriter .  fortunately , simon birch isn't the real star of the film that bears his name .  simon is more of a catalyst , allowing his co-stars to shape the story , and the actors who fill those roles to turn in outstanding supporting performances , saving the film from an obsequious , manipulative destiny .  first and foremost is joseph mazzello ( " jurassic park " ) , who is nothing less than remarkable as simon's best friend , joe .  mazzello turns in a wonderfully layered performance for a 14 year old , ripe with laughter , pain , and tears ; he is certainly an emerging talent .  ashley judd positively beams in her role as rebecca , joe's single mother , and oliver platt is warm and tender as her boyfriend , ben .  david strathairn and jan hooks play the town's reverend and sunday school teacher respectively and their contributions uphold the high standards set by the others .  there's even a surprising yet effective uncredited cameo performance from . . .  well , that would be telling .  perhaps " suggested by " the novel is the appropriate way to go after all , since " simon birch " only focuses on one chapter , one year , of simon's extraordinary life .  the film also changes the book's ending to one that is more melodramatic , yet necessary given simon's lot .  the flavor of irving's original novel remains , however--the passions , friendships , and insecurities that come with a change of seasons to the little community of gravestown , maine , and the engaging oddballs , both big and small , who reside there .

pos@ pos neg seen may 31 , 1999 on home video ( rented ) .  one of the best things about the movies is that they can make you really start to wonder and analyze things in your own , everyday life that you might not have thought much of otherwise .  with some films it might be just a secondary issue , but with `dark city' what we get is nearly an entire film committed to philosophizing and theorizing about human memory and how it defines who we are , which is a poignant theme made through an absolutely beautifully-constructed film with the kind of story and setting that could only happen in a movie .  there's an old role-playing computer game called `d ? ja v ? ' wherein the player takes on the role of a man who can't remember who he is , where he is and how he got there .  the goal is to gather as many clues as possible to figure that out and along the way overcome a conflict .  the premise to this film is not unlike that game , only this time we don't have control over the protagonist .  we begin by meeting a seemingly ordinary man living in an extremely dark and dirty city ( actually , it's more than just the city , it's the whole reality ) that isn't just that neo-gothic look ( a la `batman , ' `blade runner , ' ) , but is so fully developed it's almost a different genre completely .  later he will learn that his name is john murdoch ( sewell ) , but for now he has no idea what's going on other than the fact something is not right .  the fact there's a dead body in the corner goes to enhance the feeling of paranoia and a mysterious , hurried call telling him to leave immediately is also very chilling .  this opening scene alone goes a long way to define the setting of the film and its bizarre , horrific tone .  the man doesn't know who he is nor where he's going and it's interesting to follow him since we the viewers have no idea either we can sympathize and identify with him .  in fact , this is the way all stories begin since it's impossible to know the history of a character , their feelings , values , morals , etc . until after we've observed them for a while .  but in this case , the total feeling of amnesia is an excellent tool towards characterization , developing the mood and outlining the story .  eventually , some semblance of a plot begins to unfold as it appears that john is a serial killer wanted by the police .  we met inspector frank bumstead ( hurt ) , a quiet , unemotional , soft-spoken deadpan man who appears to have been on the trail of the killer for some time .  two other important characters are also introduced : dr . daniel p . schreber ( sutherland ) , a neurotic psychiatrist who claims to be john's doctor ; and emma murdoch ( connelly ) , a jazz singer dolled up to look like a caraciture right out of the old dick tracy serials or any given leading lady of the old film-noir movies .  it was schreber who contacted john for reasons that are continually revealed throughout the course of the film .  he also contacts emma , which further helps the film reveal what is seemingly a complex , mysterious back story .  but absolutely nothing is as it appears to be in `dark city , ' which is what makes it so fascinating throughout its continual scenes of confusion and vertigo .  everything the filmmakers want us to see has some significance - considering how intricate the detail is to every single shot , its lighting , art direction and overall production design , they don't seem to be able to afford any gratuities .  however , that might also be what's keeping it from reaching its maximum potential .  by continuing to follow john as he wanders around this strange place , so much unlike the real world we know , we come to realize that it's all a hoax .  everyone in the city is the subject of an experiment being conducted by a race of aliens to understand what makes humans tick in their efforts to somehow save themselves from extinction .  but , as the film's tagline says , `last night , one of us went off . '  for reasons that are never clearly explained , it appears that john possesses telekinetic powers to can do pretty much whatever his mind can conceive ( a process known as `tuning' ) .  the aliens , which look like very old bald human men with pasty skin , also possess the power en masse and use it to change the city every night at midnight .  at the same time all the humans fall asleep and after the changes are made , they awake and either continue where they left off or begin a new life they have no idea they did not have until then .  this premise certainly is interesting and director and co-screenwriter alex proyas is able to keep the film consistently mysterious in this regard .  he does provide some explanations such as that dr . schreber is an assistant to `the strangers' because he somehow could synthesize memory into chemical form .  the aliens mix and match the memories of the city's population to see who will change and who will not .  in the process this creates for a good deal of deep , thought-provoking philosophies that could be applied to the real world .  however , where the film errs is by not playing up the idea of memory versus the human heart as to what makes a person who he or she is .  the main characters are all closely intertwined within the seemingly complex murder mystery which never actually happened , yet when they start to go through some of the expected emotions it comes off as distant , static and cold ( mediocre performances by hurt and connelly don't help either ) .  for example , john realizes emma is not and probably never was his wife so he does not feel an emotional bond to her , yet in some scenes crucial to the film's plot , we are expected to believe they do have a genuine love for each other , which is also part of the film's climax and ending .  and that's what proyas seems to be inferring with the film , but never quite manages to convey in its fullest sense .  ironically , this is what made his first film `the crow' work so well , which had a similar theme of struggling to find hope and the human spirit within a nearly identical , dark twisted world .  with `dark city' the messenger seems to be mistaken for the message .  still , the film is by no means bad and is consistently entertaining and enjoyable .  there's a lot to like here , most notably the sheer visual look and style of it all which accounts for at least half the reasons the film is able to tell the story it does .  the story as a whole is one of the most original to come out of hollywood in years .  `dark city' is what the movies are all about - the escape from the real world .

"  that's fair enough .  all movies , like all school children , should be given the benefit of the doubt .  the chance to succeed .  after all , we like to think that the right combination of talent and effort can do wonders .  mountains can be moved , and good movies can be made .  yeah right .  children fail , as do films .  as does director john boorman's latest .  the success of beyond rangoon hinges on the believability of patricia arquette ( ed wood , true romance ) as the busty westerner-in-peril wandering about 1988 burma without a passport .  though we can stomach the mild plot contrivances that get her there , it's a tougher task to overlook the actress .  she's a lightweight .  as the first scene ( with narration ! )  demonstrates , she doesn't have * nearly * enough range for the emotions that her character--a mother fleeing the memories of a murdered husband and son--is supposed to show .  she may give a stronger performance than , say , keanu reeves in a walk in the clouds , by not by much .  beyond rangoon is a very physically appealing film , thanks to the practiced craftsmanship of john boorman ( deliverance , excalibur , hope and glory ) .  he keeps the narrative moving , no matter how muddy the story--or the heroine--gets .  why he chose arquette remains a mystery , though .  maybe he was thinking that the dramatic weight of the story would overcome any casting deficiencies .  but even after an hour of half-stated political statements and murky mass killings , we * still * don't know enough of what's happening in this country to feel distressed for the characters or their situations .  empty exoticism .  the technical credits in beyond rangoon are a curious mix , combining lush jungle photography with bad blue-screen work .  also odd is the obvious dubbing .  done to make some of the foreign characters sound less foreign ?  and , is it my mistake , or do the same extras keep reappearing as different soldiers ? ?  doo doo doo doo .

pos@ pos neg when you go to the movies as much as i do , you unfortunately end up seeing certain movie trailers one too many times .  such was the case with frequency .  every time i went to a screening , there was the frequency preview .  it looked awful .  it looked cheesy , sappy and ridiculous .  it looked like a flop .  well , whoever put that trailer together should be fired , because in terms of pure entertainment , frequency is one of the best of the year thus far .  frequency boasts a compelling story line .  an occurrence of freakish solar activity allows police detective john sullivan ( james caviezel ) to speak to his fireman father frank sullivan ( dennis quaid ) through a ham radio , despite the fact that frank has been dead for 30 years .  john is able to give his father information that prevents his death in a warehouse fire , but by doing so causes other changes .  somehow , a serial killer's reign of terror , which in the original timeline had been stopped at three murders , extends to ten victims . . .  including john's mother .  this is director gregory hoblit's third film ( the other two being primal fear and fallen ) .  with all three , he's managed to attach himself to great scripts ( this one by toby emmerich , whose only previous movie experience was as a music supervisor on numerous new line films ) and add equally great direction .  also , he apparently likes to have his films wrap up with a kick-ass ending .  frequency is no exception , the ending is unpredictable and incredibly satisfying .  hoblit is three for three , and i hope he can keep it up .  now everyone can argue logic this and logic that all you want with the sci-fi elements of frequency .  but the fact of the matter is that time travel has never been achieved .  who's to say how something works and how it doesn't when it's never happened ?  is it because we've become accustomed to time travel " laws " from other places like " star trek " and the back to the future trilogy and " quantum leap " ?  yes , if you sit down and think about it , certain plot elements in this film probably won't make any sense .  most films are like that .  don't let that dissuade you from seeing this fantastically entertaining film however .  when frequency was over , it made me wish i had seen it with my father so i could have given him a hug ( okay okay , shut up ) .  when you break it down past all its sci-fi elements and serial killer antics , frequency is simply a movie about a father and his son and the bond that they share .  it's touching , it's sincere , and it's what ultimately makes this movie work .

neg@ pos neg michael crichton has had a long career of writing novels , many of which are science fiction .  the most profitable film adaptation of any novel was an adaptation of a michael crichton science fiction novel .  so in the logic of the film industry a good way to make a profitable film would be to make a big-budget adaptation of another crichton science fiction novel .  congo failed , and i am afraid that sphere is probably not going to fare a whole lot better .  it a little better than just okay novel and it makes a film that is not even that good .  the film is expensive , over one hundred million dollars ; is long , 133 minutes ; has a terrific cast , including dustin hoffman , samuel l . jackson , and sharon stone ; but has little that is really original and less that is exciting .  several years ago dr . norman goodman ( played by dustin hoffman ) was asked to write up a set of procedures for the government to follow if an alien entity was actually encountered .  the plan he wrote was only semi-serious , but did explicitly define a team of experts who should investigate the alien .  now that team has been assembled by a mysterious team leader named barnes ( peter coyote ) to study a spacecraft almost a half mile in length that apparently dropped into the pacific ocean in the early 1700s .  suddenly norman's less than serious procedure has become an action plan for dealing with a real alien spacecraft .  included in the team to investigate are mathematician harry adams ( samuel l . jackson ) , biologist beth halperin ( sharon stone ) , and astrophysicist ted fielding ( liev schreiber ) .  together they travel to the deep pacific spaceship to understand its secrets .  one major secret is the meaning of the huge sphere of gold-toned liquid metal at the heart of this spaceship .  what is disappointing about this film is that it does not have really effective performances .  director barry levinson is at his best with good actors rather than good special effects .  the problem here is he is making a big-budget science fiction film .  it has some effects , but the most intriguing effect he shows only as an outline on a radar screen .  the technique is to suggest rather than to show and let the actors and the viewer's imagination carry the film as robert wise did with the haunting .  that could be a reasonable approach in a low-budget film .  but that requires creating much more atmosphere than levinson can manage to muster .  it requires the actors to give really compelling performances and simply put , they don't .  hoffman's acting seems muted .  jackson seems to laid back .  we do not feel for these characters and do not get inside their heads .  levinson paid big bucks for his actors and does not really get price performance .  and why we have queen latifah as a minor functionary on the expedition is anybody's guess . a  cast of unknowns could have delivered as much emotional impact at a fraction of the price .  look how much more powerful a film like alien was with only moderate actors .  most science fiction spectaculars these days have second-tier actors and first-tier special effects .  levinson tries second-tier effects , and first-tier actors , but never makes that exchange pay off for the viewer .  perhaps sci-fi spectaculars are just not an actor's medium .  the result gets a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . 
pos@ pos neg it's been a long time since walt disney has delivered us a classic along the lines of the little mermaid or beauty and the beast .  sure , there have been delightful outings like last years hercules .  but nothing entirely groundbreaking .  with the release of the studio's newest feature length film , a remake of edgar rice burrough's creation tarzan , disney has plunged into new waters with both maturity and animation techniques .  it's no classic , but this new tarzan represents exactly what a family film should be .  the plot is loyal to the original storyline , as tarzan's parents are forced to abandon their ship which has caught fire , and find shelter in the jungles of africa .  but , they are killed ( offscreen ) by the snarling cheetah sabor , leaving baby tarzan alone and unharmed in his crib .  found by kala ( voiced with effective gentleness by glenn close ) , a kindhearted mother and member of a gorilla pack , tarzan is taken into the primate group and raised as one of their own .  we follow the young boy through the years , as he partakes in various adventures with his loud mouth gorilla friend terk ( a very brash but funny rosie o'donnell ) and clumsy elephant tantor ( wayne knight ) .  of course , in any disney film we are given some kind of goofy sidekick or humorous chum for the hero .  in tarzan , these characters fill that space rather inconspicuously .  gags that were magnified in other family films are kept quite minor here .  most of the characters are amusing without being forced .  as tarzan grows to manhood , the suspected antagonist stumbles into the picture .  here , the notorious bad guy is the big game hunter clayton ( brian blessed ) , who's accompanying a hapless professor ( nigel hawthorne ) on an expedition through the jungle .  of course , there's the professor's daughter , jane ( nicely vocalized by a cheerful minnie driver ) who will help supply the romantic quotient of the movie .  the thing that blew my socks off about this version of tarzan is the stunning animation .  directors chris buck and kevin lima have applied a breathtaking 3-d element to the movement of the athletic title character , and the fast-paced editing is absolutely a marvel .  as tarzan carries jane through the treetops , narrowly escaping a pack of nasty baboons , he slips and slides like a daredevil snow boarder or star surfer riding the big wave .  your eyes can barely keep up ; it's a fantastic accomplishment .  the subject matter here is also a notch or two above animation average .  there are important questions raised about tarzan's place in the world , and all are handled exceptionally well by the screenwriters .  there is no shred of doubt left to ponder afterward , which is a surprising plus that i wasn't expecting to find here .  suffice to say , this film will have both adults and children thoroughly entertained .  the grown-up tarzan is voiced by tony goldwyn , who made a name for himself as the `big mean jerk' from ghost .  goldwyn is effective playing someone who's not aware of his world's dangers .  glenn close is also memorable as his gorilla mother , and lance henriksen ( from tv's millennium ) is terrific as the silverback father unsure of how to accept the presence of a human child .  as the movie's villain , there is nothing particularly special or catching about the character of clayton .  it helps that brian blessed supplies his voice with game enthusiasm , but he is nothing compared to james woods' hilarious hades from hercules .  a burley guy with a big gun who just wants to capture the gorillas does not quite constitute for an all-together noticeable screen presence .  still , this is one great thrill-ride that disney has constructed .  i never expected rice burrough's work to be transformed so successfully from live action to animation , nor with so much emotional depth .  parents , along with all the kiddies , are going to find much to like in tarzan .

" lightweight " doesn't begin to describe it .  this is like anti-gravity .  it begins in a new york city bloomingdale's , a product placement that rivals cast away's fedex for sheer blatancy .  jonathan trager ( john cusack ) and sara thomas ( kate beckinsale ) both go for the same pair of gloves .  after going through the perfunctory motions , jonathan gets to keep the gloves and the two of them go out for ice cream , followed by ice skating .  jonathan falls hard , and sara is charmed .  when she writes her name and number down on a piece of paper , a truck rumbles by and blows it out of her hand .  she takes this as a sign from fate that they shouldn't be together ; jonathan is flabbergasted .  to pacify him , she comes up with an idea : jonathan will write his number on a 5 dollar bill , which she will promptly spend .  when she gets home , she will write her name and number inside a book ( " love in the time of cholera " ) and sell it to a used bookstore .  if the bill gets back to her or the book to him , it will mean that they are meant to be together .  three years later .  both sara and jonathan are now engaged to other love interests .  both realize they aren't content .  both go looking for the other .  what happens now is so absurd that i'm almost tempted to recommend the film for the sake of seeing it .  the two of them run circles around each other in a set of incredible " coincidences " that i would describe as contrivances if it weren't for the film oh-so-cleverly dismissing that criticism by building its plot around " serendipity . "  of course , since the movie is about fate , the screenwriter can do anything he damn well pleases .  i'm not buying it .  there's no suspense in any of this because we know exactly what's going to happen , but serendipity insists on drilling its purportedly " adorable " non-story into our heads .  instead of " will they meet ? "  the question we're asking is " when will they meet already ?

pos@ pos neg director david fincher has such an eye for detail which is very rare in hollywood these days ( terry gilliam comes to mind as another one ) .  film is one of the best art forms because not only can you tell a story , but you can use the camera to capture the smallest detail and have it mean something .  but most directors seem to go for action with the slightest ounce of a story .  so whenever a director uses the camera to its fullest potential , the film almost automatically deserves a good review .  and when they add a fascinating story to it , you have nearly perfect entertainment .  fincher's the game is no exception to this .  the game is one of the most interesting and complex films to come out of hollywood in a long time .  fincher hasn't made a film since " seven , " his box office and critical hit which defied expectations and became one of the best movies ever .  so it is about time he made another film .  and what a ride it is .  the game isn't quite as powerful as " seven , " but in some ways it is better .  overall , the game could have used a little more clarity , or a little more uncertainty .  it walks a line of insanity and reality , but it never goes either way until the very end .  the outcome is satisfying enough for the preceding events , and it makes a lot of sense once everything is set straight .  unfortunately , unlike " the usual suspects , " we are never given enough information to figure out for ourselves what is happening , whether it be true or false .  however , this also gives the film a frightening aspect which the game uses to the fullest extent .  the game is told completely from its main character's point of view .  nicholas van orton ( michael douglas ) is a high-strung and isolated businessman .  he lives alone in his giant mansion , divorced from his wife elizabeth , and is celebrating his 48th birthday ; the same age at which his father committed suicide at , in the same mansion .  for his 48th birthday , conrad ( sean penn ) , the rebel of the family , gives nicholas a gift certificate to crs : consumer recreation services .   " it will make your life fun again , " his brother promises .  as skeptical as nicholas is , he is somewhat intrigued , and annoyed by the lack of information--something this businessman hates .  seeing a billboard in an office , he decides to visit the mysterious company .  jim feingold ( james rebhorn ) greets nicholas and guides him through the sign-up process , which consists of psych-tests , physicals , emotional responses , and other mind games .   " each game is suited to each person's emotional and psychological needs , " explains feingold .  one day , nicholas gets a call from crs and they explain that he failed the tests .  even more intrigued and now somewhat angered at the time he spent signing up , he starts asking around to see what people can tell him about the company .  what he doesn't realize is that the game has already begun .  the phone call is just the first of many strange events to be thrown nicholas' way .  how he finds out that he is involved has to be witnessed because it is amusing and fun and visually impressive .  the detail involved in fincher's shots is incredible and almost requires a second viewing just to appreciate the effort that went into them .  with " seven , " fincher had almost every single shot mean something .  he also has the unique ability to make you look at exactly what he wants you to .  compared to " seven , " though , the game is light and comical .  because of this film's sense of humor and self-awareness , nothing can be taken quite seriously .  so don't try to make much sense of what goes on in the game , because it doesn't want you to .  what does make sense is the final revelation--when everything becomes apparent and clear .  if taken as it is , the game's ending makes complete sense .  but if you try and critique every minute detail , then you get yourself into plot holes and incredibility .  perhaps that is the reason i docked the film .  while trying to remain realistic and plausible , the plot is too unbelievable to create any real tension on screen .  we don't really care if douglas' character lives or not because it isn't believable .  the ending requires you to have believed anything that has happened previously , but if you suspend disbelief and take the film as it is , you can accept the game as an emotionally and psycholically disturbing thriller .  michael douglas gives a terrific performance as nicholas .  douglas has played lonely businessmen before , but here he adds another level to his performance .  his character , who is normally level-headed and relies on facts , is forced to trust nobody .  can he believe the waitress he bumped into ?  what about his brother who got him involved in the game in the first place ?  douglas portrays this aspect of his character extremely well , and gives one of his best performances ( even better than his " falling down " persona ) .  the supporting cast is essential in this film , and casting was critical .  sean penn is always good , and he gives yet another credible performance as douglas' brother .  deborah kara unger ( from " crash " ) is the waitress he bumps into , and her performance is extremely good .  in fact , she almost steals the film from douglas .  james rebhorn portrays his character very well , and adds some confusion and desparation to douglas' predicament .  another good performance comes from armin mueller-stahl ( from " shine " ) as the book editor .  but considering that douglas is in every single scene of the game , he not only commands this cast , but makes this distant and lonely character come to colorful life .  the game is rated r for language , violence , some gore , and some nudity and drugs .  what is essential for this film to work is the writing .  john brancato and michael ferris have woven a confusing and compelling screenplay with witty dialogue , and some very funny moments .  this screenplay will probably get an oscar nomination for best original screenplay because it does almost exactly the same thing the usual suspects' did .  however , the visuals of the game are enough to make the viewer enjoy the vexing plot .  and if you can get yourself to believe everything occuring on the screen , you will be thoroughly entertained by one of this year's best films . 
neg@ pos neg there is a rule when it comes to movies .  a sequel is never as good as the original .  there are very few exceptions to this rule , and texas chainsaw massacre : the next generation is not one of them .  now if you also take into consideration that the original chainsaw massacre was a really bad movie , and that this isn't even the first sequel to it , you have a recipe for a very painful viewing experience .  don't be fooled by the presence of up and coming talents matthew mcconaughey ( a time to kill ) and renee zellweger ( jerry maguire ) .  they made this movie before they were stars .  judging by their performances they also made it before they took any acting lessons .  it's a wonder they ever worked in hollywood again after appearing in this turkey .  apparently the producers of this film realized just how bad it was , because it sat unreleased for years until someone decided that they might be able to capitalize off the success of mcconaughey and zellweger .  apparently the two young stars were none too happy about this thing ever seeing the light of day .  and i don't blame them , they would have been better off if this had been some sort of porno flick starring the two of them .  unfortunately for them it is a horror film in which zellweger plays your typically stupid horror film character .  while mcconaughey plays a guy who wears a mechanical brace on his leg that he controls with a television remote control .   ( hey , don't say i didn't warn you . )  to make matters worse , leatherface , the chainsaw wielding maniac , who was never the scariest of psychopathic killers at the best of times , has now become a full blown cross-dresser , and spends the entire movie in drag .  there is a plot to this movie but it isn't worth mentioning .  let's just suffice to say that a group of teenagers are in the typical wrong place at the wrong time and are left to the mercy of remote control man ( mcconaughey ) and his lipstick wearing chainsaw revving half-witted sidekick .  man , i can't get over just how bad this movie is .  this film has absolutely no redeeming qualities .  even the obligatory topless babe shot wasn't enough to hold my interest for more than 2 seconds .  the writing is bad , the direction is even worse , but both of those things look good in comparison to the acting .  this is the sort of movie that they should make people in prison watch .  a guarantee you , if criminals thought that they would be subjected to this film they would never break the law again .

'  and diaz adds some brightness to this film as a wedding-needing fiancee .  but her talents are essentially wasted here .  it's obvious that the film maker is trying to strike a certain tone .  but the way that he chooses to do it is tasteless .  do not make a very bad decision by seeing this film .

"  first time helmer john cameron mitchell , along with composer/lyricist stephen trask , created and starred in their acclaimed off-broadway production that has become the movie .  and quite a movie it is in its eclectic variety of songs , outrageous costumes , sets and makeup and , especially , a riveting performance by mitchell as the title character .  mitchell and trask have reinvented the movie musical and couple it with the underlying story of just whom hedwig is and what she is looking for .  i am , by far , not a big fan of musicals .  sure , there are exceptions , like bob fosse's " all that jazz " and " cabaret , " but , for the most part , they are just not my cup of tea .   " hedwig and the angry inch " is an exception , though , with its combination of humor , wit and a collection of tunes that covers musical styles ranging from " the rocky horror picture show " and meatloaf to david bowie to the sex pistols .  the original songs , by stephen trask ( also appearing as one of the members of the band the angry inch ) , are full of energy and variety and , even though it's not my kind of music , i found every one entertaining and fun .  the audience i saw " hedwig " with thought so , too .  the main attraction to this one-man/woman show is the presence of its star .  john cameron mitchell gives a solid , sometimes fun , sometimes angry performance as a person searching for self-enlightenment and love .  as a young boy growing up in east berlin , hansel is abused by his g . i .  father and raised by his german mother in a tiny flat so small that " mother would make me play in the oven " where he listened to pop music on armed forces radio .  later , as a young man , he meets luther , another g . i .  and is swept off of his feet .  the ensuing angry inch incident comes soon after .  flash forward to a trailer park in junction city , kansas , and luther is leaving hedwig for another boy .  frustrated and broke , she takes on baby-sitting and the odd " job " to make ends meet .  she also forms a band with four korean housewives and the musical talent of hedwig is born .  she meets , falls for and loses young tommy , who steals her songs and goes off to become a rock sensation .  jealous and angry , hedwig and her new band begins a campaign to shadow tommy's tours and , with the help of her manager , phyllis stein ( andrea martin ) , is trying get a law suit going against the star for stealing her songs .  hedwig and the angry inch get gigs , not coincidentally , at a chain of seafood restaurants that just happen to be next to the forums where tommy gnosis is playing .  things finally come to a head , so to speak , in new york city .  the popularity of the off-broadway musical and its offshoots have garnered a ready-made audience base for " hedwig . "  the wit , humor , music and search for identity has great appeal to young adults , but the charismatic presence of mitchell makes this a cut above what it could have been .  it is this one-man/woman show that casts its spotlight on its " internationally ignored " rock star and mitchell is outstanding in the role .  there isn't a lot going on with other characters , though there are amusing little sidebars , like hedwig's backup singer/lover , yitzak ( miriam shor ) , deciding to break away from the band to join a polynesian road show of " rent " as a puerto rican drag queen .  the low budget that the moviemakers have for the production belies the quality of the film .  attention to details - hedwig's costumes and outrageous " cabaret " -like makeup ; the seedy trailer park setting ; and , the kitschy seafood restaurants - are loads of fun to watch and lend the appropriate air to the proceeds , all on what has to be a beer budget .   " hedwig and the angry inch " may not be for everybody , but the energy of the effort , the songs , the imaginative sets and costumes and a fast steady pace make it a pleasure to watch .  if you're a fan of contemporary , edgy music , it is an even bigger draw .  i give it a b+ . 
neg@ pos neg a number of critics have decided that it's open season on freddie prize jr . , slamming the young actor as an utterly talentless pretty boy on career cruise control in sound-alike , disposable teen fluff like " head over heels , " " boys and girls , " " down to you " and " she's all that . "  while the prinze oeuvre is hard to defend , his talent is not .  i first saw him in the independent dark comedy " the house of yes , " where he gave a subtle , impressive performance as the younger brother in one of america's freakiest families .  prinze has the acting chops ; he just needs to take a few supporting roles in some grown-up movies to show the non-believers that he has what it takes .   " summer catch " certainly won't help his case .  inoffensive , but utterly generic , the baseball-related romantic comedy does little more than kill time .  the story deals with the love affair between tenley ( jessica biel ) , a wealthy cape cod girl and ryan ( prinze ) , a local boy from a working class family who dreams of becoming a big-time baseball star .  ryan's preoccupation with his new honey-bunny drives her elitist father ( bruce davison ) crazy and endangers his position as pitcher with a cape cod summer league team .  it's a wonder the kid has any time to pitch , as his time is occupied with making out with tenley , fighting with her dad , bonding with his own dad ( fred ward , who deserves better than this ) , fighting with his brother ( jason gedrick ) and carousing at a neighborhood bar with his teammates .  the filmmakers desperately want to make a quirky , character-heavy baseball movie like " bull durham , " but haven't got a clue how to get there .  and so they glide from one clich ? to the next for 108 minutes .  the only bit of originality comes from marc blucas in a minor role as a center-fielder from texas .  in an early barroom scene , blucas , best known as demon-fighting riley finn from " buffy the vampire slayer , " hears a young woman compliment a guy on his ass , then turns to teammate matthew lillard and states , " he does have a nice ass .  a bubble butt . "  when lillard gives him an " are you insane ? "  look , blucas calmly says , " it's nothing sexual , " then goes on to evaluate the hind-ends of some other players , including lillard's .  speaking of asses , prinze does not bare his in the movie .  the actor has a no nudity clause in his contract , so two stunt-butts were employed for a couple of semi-nude shots .  blucas , whose character secretly dates a large woman throughout the story , gets another unique moment late in the film .  sick of hearing teammates make " fat chick " jokes , he climbs on top of a table and loudly declares his love of amply-sized ladies .  while his speech still ends up objectifying women , it remains a nice change of pace in a numbingly ordinary movie .  trivial tidbit : " summer catch " marks a scooby doo summit .  marc blucas appears in " jay and silent bob strike back " as fred from the scooby doo gang , while freddie prinze jr . plays the same character in the upcoming big budget film version of the old cartoon .

pos@ pos neg with the exception of their surrealistic satire barton fink , the films of joel and ethan coen fit into two broad categories : quirky and sometimes darkly humorous takes on the " film noir " genre in which crime schemes go wrong and spin increasingly out of control ( fargo , miller's crossing , blood simple ) , and off-the-wall comedies centered around an eccentric , scatter-brained lead character ( raising arizona , the hudsucker proxy ) .  their latest offering , the big lebowski , falls within the latter category , though there are elements of the crime-gone-wrong theme and even a touch of satire to be found in this film .  the main difference , however , is that while the protagonists of raising arizona and the hudsucker proxy had lofty aspirations and ideals but didn't quite have the brains to get it all together , the main character of the big lebowski seems like a fairly intelligent guy who's wise to the world , but he doesn't really want to do much of anything besides go bowling , smoke pot , and generally relax .  that main character is jeffrey " the dude " lebowski ( jeff bridges ) , introduced by the film's rambling narrator ( sam elliott ) as " quite possibly the laziest man in los angeles county . "  the dude is unemployed , needless to say , and spends most of his time at the bowling alley with his two best friends , walter ( john goodman ) , a borderline-psychotic who's in the habit of pulling a gun when he thinks somebody's cheating in a bowling match ( " has the whole world gone crazy ? ! " he shouts at a suspected cheater ) , and donny ( steve buscemi ) , who's always a few steps behind the conversation and is constantly berated by walter for it ( " donny , you have no frame of reference here ! " ) .  these three seem to more or less live for bowling tournaments , and as the film begins they are anticipating an important match with rival bowler jesus quintana ( john turturro ) , who , when we first meet him , is doing a dance in the bowling lane to accompany a spanish version of " hotel california " and , if it's possible , seems to be even more of a head case than walter .  if that doesn't give you a good idea of this film's absurdist tone , then perhaps this will : the entire scenario which drives the story is set in motion by two thugs mistakenly urinating on the dude's rug .  they've mistaken him for a millionaire of the same name who is also known as the " big " lebowski ( david huddleston ) and whose nymphomaniac wife bunny ( tara reid ) owes money to porn producer jackie treehorn ( ben gazzara ) .  the dude goes to the big lebowski seeking compensation for his ruined rug ; he doesn't have any luck , but when bunny is apparently kidnapped , the elder lebowski asks him to deliver the $1 million ransom .  unfortunately , walter gets involved and fouls up the drop-off , and before they can try again to get the money to the supposed kidnappers , the dude's car gets stolen , along with the briefcase containing the money .  soon , the dude is being harassed not only by the big lebowski himself but also by treehorn and by a group of german " nihilists " who demand the ransom money even though they may not have been involved in the kidnapping in the first place ; the dude and walter suspect that bunny may well have kidnapped herself in order to extort money from her husband to repay her debts to treehorn .  meanwhile , the big lebowski's daughter maude ( julianne moore ) , a feminist avant-garde artist who likes to make grand entrances swinging through the air naked , wants to recover the money for her family .  the plot , however , is really just a vehicle for all these bizarre characters to run wild and wreak their own unique forms of havoc .  the previews for the big lebowski feature creedence clearwater revival's " run through the jungle , " and it fits : the coens see los angeles as a veritable jungle of oddballs and nutcases , with the sometimes bewildered dude left to run through it and try to avoid any more trouble ( usually unsuccessfully ) .  the film doesn't feature quite as many one-liners and sight gags as the coens' other comedies ( though there are a few hilarious moments of visual humor , particularly in the dude's dream sequences and acid flashbacks ) , but it more than makes up for it with the sheer fun of watching these strange characters interact .  the film sometimes seems a little disjointed as a result - you get the feeling that the coens have not only set their characters loose in this " jungle " but are also themselves running crazy through the jungle of their own twisted imaginations - but for the most part the characterizations are interesting enough to overcome the shaky plotting and what turns out to be a somewhat anticlimactic resolution .  there's also a noticeable ( but not too heavy-handed ) thread of social commentary in the big lebowski , which , incidentally , takes place just as the gulf war is about to begin ; at the beginning , we see george bush on television making his " this aggression will not stand " speech .  the coens take aim at just about every elite l . a . subculture in the book : the egotistical wealthy businessman ( " the bums will always lose ! "  shouts the big lebowski at one point ) , the porn industry , the overbearing malibu policeman who berates the dude for disturbing their " peaceful beach community , " and so on .  by the end , we really start to admire the dude , who almost certainly harbors the least " aggression " of anyone in this story ; his passive resistance ( emphasis on " passive , " albeit ) to the elite emerges as something more than just another quirky characterization in a film overflowing with quirky characters .  he also turns out to have a pretty well-functioning brain in his head , even if he doesn't like to use it very much ; his sarcasm towards treehorn and the malibu policeman shows that he knows when he's getting a run around , and he does manage to unravel the kidnapping mystery by the end .  the coens certainly poke fun at the dude for his laziness , but they don't just treat him as fodder for cheap shots either .  i think that , more than anything , is what makes the big lebowski a standout comedy : it manages to approach characters like the dude and , to some extent , walter , with genuine affection while still acknowledging that they are pretty scatter-brained .  audience members may find themselves surprised at how much they like the un-dynamic duo by the end of the movie , given that they seemed like nothing more than the butts of an extended joke at first .   " it's good knowin' he's out there , the dude , takin' it easy , " posits the narrator towards the end .  i dare say that truer words have seldom been spoken . 
neg@ pos neg a highly intelligent life form that is completely electronic in nature , beams itself onto a russian science vessel .  well , this is the point where the movie strays from becoming a decent and original movie and simply becomes a predictable sci-fi thriller .  anyhow , this life form takes control of the computers on the russian vessel then starts creating highly advanced robots to help it in its gruesome task of exterminating the ? virus' known as man .  the original crew of the russian vessel is all but exterminated , and then a hapless crew on a tug discovers the derelict ship and tries to salvage it .  no more needs to be said as to what happens and where the conflict lies , the movie is that predictable .  the story is full of very shallow characters that don't do much other than subsist .  the captain of the tug , played by donald sutherland , makes irrational choice after irrational choice leaving the audience wondering as to how he has survived long enough to reach his age ( looks to be in his 60's ) .  to add to this we're shown this motley crew that at times seems to be highly skilled in specific fields , and at others seems barely capable of basic tasks .  some of the supposed capabilities of the characters leads one to wonder what they are doing on a tug transporting cargo in the middle of the pacific , in a typhoon no less .  none of the characters seem to work together at all ; they are always bickering and vying for some form of control .  this makes no sense what so ever and only takes away from the story , a story that is full of holes and is extremely predictable .  all the flaws of the actual story are only helped along by the special effects .  the waves that are generated to be part of the typhoon make it look like boat was is small model sitting in a tub and someone is simply creating waves .  it looks genuinely fake , granted trying to recreate a typhoon or hurricane cannot be easy by any stretch of the imagination but having the storm approach in a style similar to the huge wave of deep impact only ends up looking corny and amateurish .  also on the topic of flaws , the robotics that the advanced life form creates seem to move extremely slowly , why ?  if this life form that is so advanced as to be able to create these robotics , should it not be able to create them move faster ?  regardless , the special effects in this movie in many cases take away from the film rather than add to it .  as to the actual casting for the movie , finally there is nothing to complain about .  the actors were superb , but then again it is highly doubtful that chimpanzees would have had difficulty acting the roles .  having the cast that was present probably saved this movie from being an absolute catastrophe .  watching these actors act this story out made it bearable , if barely .  the one saving grace of this movie is that it was highly action packed and there always seemed to be something happening .  so if you are going into this movie not expecting to see anything grand and are only going to kill some time and watch a mediocre sci-fi thriller then you won't be too disappointed .  as the movie is but the latest in a genre that was originally created by aliens , it does little more than try to cash in on that aspect .  this movie would be best left for video and even then you might be advised to simply wait for one of the major networks to air it on tv . 
pos@ pos neg the release of dolores claiborne into wide release this weekend adds another entry into the long list of film adaptations of stephen king's work .  this slow-moving character study provides some outstanding acting performances by the principals , but suffers from a tepid conclusion , inconsistent direction , and may not have wide commercial appeal .  when the maid , dolores claiborne , is found brandishing a rolling pin standing over the bloody and dead body of her employer , it seems like an open-and-shut murder case .  upon hearing of the death via a mysterious fax , dolores' estranged and bitter daughter , esquire magazine writer selena st . george , returns from new york back to her tiny island village childhood home .  as the two clash horns , the story behind the mysterious death of dolores' abusive husband two decades ago , ruled an accident despite the protests of detective john mackey , is revealed .  did dolores kill her husband ?  and did she kill her employer ?  dolores claiborne is certainly more of a character study than a suspense thriller .  consequently , it is fortunate that their cast includes some of hollywood's finest character actors , such as bates , leigh and strathairn .  kathy bates plays the film's title character , and gives a sensational lead performance .  dolores claiborne is essentially a showcase for the talent of bates , as her character has a huge amount of screen time .  she dominates the screen , producing a character that is compelling and arresting , as we watch the character go through two decades of history via flashbacks .  kathy bates' performance is award-calibre stuff .  the rest of the cast is also very good .  jennifer jason leigh plays the perpetually sour , bitter helena st . george well , and christopher plummer seems to be enjoying himself as dolores' ever-present nemesis , the determined detective john mackey .  david strathairn is particularly interesting and suitably smarmy and despicable as dolores' husband , joe st . george .  judy parfitt is fine as dolores' tyrannic socialite employer , vera donovan--it would have been interesting to see , say , meg foster in this role .  child actor ellen muth is also worth noting as the young selena during the flashback sequences ; she is very impressive .  the direction of dolores claiborne by taylor hackford wildly varies throughout the film , ranging from some parts which are quite clever in their own right , to parts which are embarrassingly hokey .  the segues between flashbacks and the present are very hit-and-miss in terms of effectiveness .  the pacing of the film tends to be numbingly slow , which tends to undermine any suspense which might be built up .  however , the cinematography by gabriel beristain is wonderful--i particularly like the chilling ice-blue hue permeating the present-day scenes , contrasting well with the many nova scotia ocean shots--and danny elfman provides a surprisingly understated score for the film .  it would seem that the commercial potential of dolores claiborne is limited .  none of the performers in the film could be classified as a big draw , and its pacing may be a turn-off to those expecting a gripping suspense film filled with twists and turns and car crashes and axe-wielding psychopaths .  although being essentially the only film in its genre in release now , it may also be hurt by the negative perception of king works , even with the recent critical success of the shawshank redemption and the stand .  dolores claiborne suffers from a very unsatisfying conclusion , and moves very slowly .  however , the performances are uniformly excellent , particularly kathy bates , and the film has its moments .  on my four-star scale , i give dolores claiborne three stars . 
neg@ pos neg adam sandler vehicles are never anything special , but continue to make a load of money .  which really goes to show the sad state of cinema today .  while good comedies like rushmore , to choose a recent example , gets limited release and doesn't make a lot of money , big daddy got a huge release and has made a lot of cash .  it's also nothing special and doesn't deserve the money it's making .  but i digress .  sandler plays sonny koufax , a unemployed new yorker with a seemingly low mental age .  his girlfriend makes a ultimatum to him : either wise up and get responsible , or she's leaving him .  by a strange set of events , koufax ends up with julian ( played by twins cole and dylan sprouse ) a five year old kid .  after a failed attempt to impress his girlfriend with the child , koufax decides he wants to keep the child .  however , social worker mr brooks ( mostel ) finds out that koufax isn't the real father and wants to take julian back .  koufax along with his new girlfriend layla ( lauren adams ) fight to keep the child .  big daddy really isn't that good .  many of the jokes revolve around toilet humour , and supposedly we are meant to find julian and sonny peeing against a wall to be funny .  there's the occasional good one liner , but these are usually strangely delivered wrong and lose most of the humour .  the film , after all these silly gags , then suddenly turns sentimental , and this is where big daddy really goes from bad to hideous .  the court scene at the end of the film is useless and unbelievable , and not helped by the soppy overacting .  it's a poor attempt to win over the audience .  adam sandler basically plays the same role he has in his last few films ( except the wedding singer . )  joey lauren adams is much , much better , and deserves a far better film than this trash .  steve buscemi pops up in a funny cameo , and his scenes are pretty funny .  rob schneider is also funny as a crazy delivery man .  the two twins who play julian are o . k , they start out rather well , but then becoming annoying and brattish halfway through and finally turn 'all american' wholesome goodness at the end of the film , where the tear juice is turned up high .  big daddy is really nothing special , and is not even worth it for a few chuckles .  although it is actually well put together , with nice direction , good production design and even some montages , this professionalism can't help the fact that the script and characters are trash .  big daddy is for die hard fans of sandler , and that's about it . 
pos@ pos neg every once in a while you see a film that is so effective in delivering the goods that it is easy to forget , and forgive , its glaring imperfections .  such is the case with ? good will hunting ? , a subtle character study about a socially inept mathematics genius who struggles to find his path in life .  despite some serious character problems , this is still a very good film .  you probably know about the plot so i ? ll make it quick .  will hunting ( damon ) is a janitor at m . i . t . , he ? s really smarter than einstein but nobody knows it .  he likes to go out with his friend chuckie ( affleck ) and their other working-class buddies and drink beer .  he ? s good-looking , charismatic , and witty but has a terrible time with authority and stiff college folk .  after getting into a tiff with the law , a distinguished professor ( skarsg ? rd ) discovers will ? s genius and offers him a chance to clean up his record and avoid jail time , at a price : he must attend weekly sessions with a therapist and work on various mathematical problems ( that have stumped the academic elite ) with the professor .  after outsmarting and scaring the hell out of a couple of different psychologists he meets his match when hooked up with a once-promising therapist named sean maguire ( williams ) who has his own problems .  in the meantime will meets a british medical school student ( driver ) and they begin to fall in love .  the story starts out well enough and is a pretty original basis for a film .  even though we ? ve seen movies about misunderstood , erratic prodigies before ( ? shine ? ring a bell ? ) , the script here creates a complex narrative that doesn ? t just focus solely on one character .  alas though , this is not a perfect film , as much as you feel like it could ? ve been while watching it .  the one real problem i had with it is the unrealistic nature of the main character .  is it possible for a lowly janitor to be this intelligent ?  of course .  is it possible for him to be estranged from any deep , human relationships ?  usually , yes .  but , is it possible for him to also be so handsome , funny , quick with the tongue , and city-street tough ?  not very likely .  come on , usually these guys are total nerds who can ? t even buy their own shirts , much less talk down a harvard student in a hip pub while picking up phone numbers from pretty med . -school  girls .  will is just a little too perfect , and in order to accept the character your disbelief suspension needs to be in excellent working condition .  the heavy-handed , anti-war statement made by will at a government job interview late in the film is also boorish , overlong , pompous , and completely unnecessary .  all this sounds pretty bad , but the film somehow makes up for it in other ways .  damon ? s acting overshadows the fact that the character is slightly unbelievable , his performance is truly extraordinary .  which leads me to the really good part of the review .  the strength of this movie can be summed up in one single word : acting .  i can ? t recall seeing a film recently that was so well-acted from top to bottom .  from minnie driver ? s frustrated lover to ben affleck ? s laid-back best friend , and all the small roles in between , the performances are magnificent .  robin williams ? skill is a given as a bereaved psychologist who could ? ve had a legendary career but was knocked off the path somewhere down the line .  the real gem though is stellan skarsg ? rd ? s turn as professor lambeau , an award-winning mathematician who feels reduced in comparison to a younger , smarter will hunting .  the scenes between williams and skarsg ? rd , as two old college pals who ? ve been brought back together by this enigmatic kid , display some of the best acting i ? ve ever seen .  when i say delivering the goods , this is what i ? m talking about .  watching these two work is what going to see movies is all about .  gus van sant ? s ( to die for , drugstore cowboy ) cold , urban direction is right on , as well as danny elfman ? s sauntering musical score .  i highly recommend ? good will hunting ? .  despite its faults , it is still an intriguing and fascinating film and you are not likely to see a better acted one this year . 
neg@ pos neg one of the most blatantly obvious signs that often-acclaimed director sidney lumet's " gloria , " a remake of the 1980 john cassavetes film , had absolutely no effect on me occurred when i was driving home from the theatre .  suddenly , i realized that since i had stood up from my theatre seat five minutes before , i had not thought once about the film i had just invested nearly two hours of my life in .  when a movie is over , aren't we supposed to think about it for a while , and have a conversation about it with the acquaintances we have just watched it with ?  i thought so , but , for one , i saw this particular picture by myself , and #2 , even if i had been with someone there wouldn't have been anything to talk about in the first place .  to be sure , " gloria " begins with a stirring , rather poignant prologue in which a seven-year-old boy's family is brutally gunned down by mobsters , in search of a disc his father had with incriminating evidence on it .  right before the men broke in , of course , his father gave him the disc to escape with .  eventually , the boy , named nicky nunez ( jean-luke figueroa ) , is caught by the mobsters , and taken back to their apartment .  meanwhile , gloria ( sharon stone ) has just gotten out of prison for a crime she didn't commit and returns to her ex-boyfriend ( jeremy northam ) to recieve the money he promised her for covering up his crime .  when he refuses to give it to her , and then hears the group of men talking about killing nicky , she leaves with him in order to save his life , but not before holding the men at gunpoint , stealing all of their money , and forcing them to strip nude .  gloria is the type of fast-talking , smart-mouthed new yorker who always seems to get involved with the wrong people , and she never expected to be stuck with a kid , but she has a heart of gold ( don't they always in this type of movie ) and is only trying to protect the boy , whom she quickly begins to form a close bond with .  the previous incarnation of " gloria " by cassavetes and starring the luminous gena rowlands , remains unseen by me , but was no doubt superior , even though i can't really imagine how this considerably dull story could be transformed into an entertaining one , regardless of the director or stars .  there is no doubt in my mind that director lumet has stuck closely to the original , but the film itself is simply lifeless , with only an occasional laugh popping up here and there so that it isn't completely unbearable to watch .  i liked , for example , a very funny climactic sequence where gloria is deciding whether to leave the school she has left the boy at , and keeps turning the car around , then driving a little ways , then slamming on the brakes and turning around again .  these bright moments , however , appear long and far between , and the majority of the film deals with the budding relationship between nicky and gloria , which is both painfully predictable and by-the-numbers .  throughout , my mind was repeatedly asking the question , " who really cares ? "  as gloria , sharon stone has adopted an over-the-top brooklyn accent that honestly doesn't sound realistic at all .  in the beginning , in fact , i was amazed at how amateurish stone's performance was , but as the film progressed she got better .  although not one of her better turns , stone does have a comic flare that refuses to be ignored .  jean-luke figeroa was fine as nicky and a little more natural than the usual child actors who are so precocious they make you want to gag .  all other actors who appeared were considerably wasted , none more than cathy moriarty , an entertaining actress in her own right , who is billed fourth and has all of one scene , as gloria's friend whom she turns to for help .  sony , the studio that released " gloria , " obviously does not have any faith in the film , and i don't blame them .  they declined to screen the picture for critics , which is never a good sign , particularly with the high-profile people involved .  although how much money a movie makes does not determine how good it is ( just look at the spectacular " in dreams , " which failed to even make the top 10 last week ) , i have a suspicion " gloria " is going to vanish from theaters faster than " ishtar , " judging from the opening night 7 : 00 p . m . showing i saw it at , where there were about ten to fifteen people present , counting myself .  although stone can be an impressive actress ( just watch her in 1995's " casino " or 1996's " last dance " if you don't believe me ) and sidney lumet can be a respectable director , there is no reasoning for why they thought the cliched story of " gloria " was worth remaking or , for that matter , why columbia pictures agreed to finance it when they could have been making a picture that actually looked like it might have an inkling of a chance to be successful . 
pos@ pos neg it may seem weird to begin a film about glam rock with a sequence that includes a spaceship , a green ovular pin , and the birth of oscar wilde , but if one really strains , they can see that perhaps maybe these connections are not half off .  wilde's philosophy was that everyone should be true to their own human nature , and the result of his following this philosophy was that he was imprisoned , loosing his family and his career .  the glam rock movement in the early 70s in england had a similar take and came to a similar demise .  the main difference was by placing makeup on their face and acting out on their deepest fantasies and inquiries about life ( mostly dealing with androgony and sexuality ) , they became less and less like themselves and more and more like everyone else .  and that's why the movement seemed to end as soon as it began .  it's been said that todd haynes' " velvet goldmine , " the film that chronicles what it was like to be a part of the movement , not only from those who experienced it but by those who created it , steals a lot from " citizen kane , " and that's true .  in the film , a british journalist in the 80s , arthur stuart ( christian bale ) , is asked to go back and find out what happened to 70s glam rock star brian slade , a fictitious rock star , who faked his own death on stage , bringing the end not only to his career but to the entire glam rock movement .  structure-wise , this totally steals from " kane , " not only from the set-up ( he interviews three people , and the story is a result of their flashbacks ) , but in other things , like the beginning ( death , then newsreel ) , and smaller details , like the bitter ex-friend in a wheelchair and the bitter ex-wife as a washed-up lounge singer , found in a bar after hours .  this is no " kane , " and it really doesn't aspire to be : it doesn't attempt to be the deep outlook of something gone like " kane " did , and it doesn't really uncover anything poignant about humanity .  instead , it uses the flashbacks as a form of contrast between the magic that was the glam rock era and the boredom that was life after glam rock for those who were participants .  the 80s scenes are dry and deliriously melancholy , equipped with a performance by bale that is perhaps appropriately dull and unengaging .  but the 70s scenes are engaging , though , not to mention addictively campy .  they radiate with gorgeous cinematography that nicely accentuates all the vibrant colors of the era , and a feel that's so eerily lighthearted that when combined with the then-footage , they become not only a symbol of decadence , but of times when everything seemed so simple .  instead of creating the world the way it was , haynes paints their own world as if it were a narcotic fairy tale : the glam rock movement was full of so much freedom and liberation that after you've experienced it , everything else seems so mundane .  there's no outside world to speak of , secluding these people inside a protective globe that will eventually crack .  haynes focuses his story on the tale of blade and the other fictitious rock hero , curt wild , and their relationship that created , molded , and then brought down the movement , reducing everyone else who contributed to it as merely that - contributors .  blade - played with reserve by the pouty jonathan rhys meyers - and wild - played with anarchic wildness by ewan mcgregor - are little more than thinly disguised recreations of david bowie and iggy pop , respectively , complete with the creation of a ziggy stardust persona named maxwell demon and the confirmation that the two rock stars may have very well not only have been one-time partners in music , but also partners in bed .  through discussions with slade's ex-manager cecil ( michael feast ) , ex-wife mandy ( toni collette , reinventing herself as an american blonde dish who fakes a british accent when with slade ) , and finally ex-partner wild , journalist stuart begins to remember his own experiences in the era , like his discovery of his rebelliousness cum conformity , including the moment when he began questioning his own sexuality ( when he opens up his first slade record , he finds a naked and green slade lying on a crimson blanket ) , and finally running away from home to be part of the london scene , finally resulting in leading a boring job in america .  haynes demonstrates that he's quite the visual auteur , molding scenes that are like long heald breaths , such as a seemingly long sequence juxtaposing a slade/wild concert of them performing a brian eno cover , " baby's on fire , " with scenes from a decadent drug party ; and the film's most wow-inspiring sequence , the first concert scene of wild with his band , the ratttz , where mcgregor lets loose so much anarchic steam that his wild iggy-esuqe movements ( including stripping naked ) and screams that the film captures that perfect moment when one discovers a major talent , and another ( slade ) discovers his idle .  even the brief music videos , spoofs of bowie's , have a rare visual flair that's pure camp , and which would cause ken russell to drool .  the best sequence , though , may be the beginning , following the prelude , a sequence which acts as the middle ground for both the actual being of the movement and the post-movement era .  in it , stuart and his mates are going to the infamous slade concert where he fakes his own death , where he kills off his alter ego maxwell demon in what appears to be a real assasination , which brought about the end of the era in one swift fake bullet .  with brian eno's famous " needle in the camel's eye " playing in the background , the scene has a detached exhileration - the song doesn't seem to be played in quite the same way the other songs are .  it has a distance that's hard to put a finger on , and it seems to represent that all this is coming to a quick and sad ending , and when one sees slade in the dressing room before the show , docked in a silver frock with wings and blue hair , depressingly staring into the mirror , it comes off as a none-too-obvious prophecy of the finale in the beginning of the film .  this movie's not so much about plot , but more about the way it is presented , making this one of those films which is classified as being " style over substance , " a statement which prompts many critics to line up for attack .  however , for the most part , the engaging part of this film is not the story but rather the way in which haynes creates this world , by using his sets , costumes , cinematography , and especially the music to play as characters in his film .  the music is especially notable .  the soundtrack , which is wall to wall , consists of old school glam rock tunes by the likes of brian eno , t-rex , and roxy music , as well as covers by slade's band ( with vocals by thom yorke , and occasionally rhys meyers himself ) , and even newer music by shudder to think that sounds uncannily bowie-like .  the cast is rather impressive , but no one really walks away with the film , and no performances are extremely good .  although eddie izzard , as slade's manager ( who challenges slade's first manager to an arm-wrestling match to see who gets control of his career ) and michael feast as the first and tragic manager come off greatly , and collette and mcgregor have their moments , rhys meyers and bale are noticably sub-par , neither putting a lot of effort into their respective roles .  some of it is at fault with the actual construction of the film by haynes .  rhys meyers' brian slade remains merely a metaphor for the glam rock era , dying when he turned into a retro-garbo , resorting to a life of salinger-ism , and found in the mid-70s to be lying around , sniffing coke off the ass of a party girl .  in fact , no one in this film is really seen as a person , rather than just as a symbol or composite of a type who thrived during the era .  bale's character is an especially tough sell : bitter and depressed by flashbacks to his young adulthood , he's not an extremely personal character , and his cliched experiences ( being hounded by the record store guys for buying a record put out by a " poof " ) never help us communicate with him .  nevertheless , rhys meyers and mcgregor have the excuses that their characters are not really characters but rather the results of an era that has left them , and others , bitter , part of which helps the film work , since this is a major piece of eye candy .  at the prime of the movie , they at least look the role of fashionable leaders - slade with his perpetually-changing , androgonys persona , and wild with his topless and unpredictable image , which clash and fuse into an unstable union .  their story - of how slade was so influenced by wild that he adapted it into a similar who-cares attitude crossed with camp - is engaging , without the personal background .  the story of stuart , though , is a tougher sell because he's the everyman , and when you can't totally identify with the everyman , your story's in slight trouble .  as a cultural rock piece , " velvet goldmine " is rather good , but it is merely good .  it never totally takes off , although it has moments where it absolutely flies , but then comes back down .  it's really nothing more than a bunch of really great moments , surrounded by material that could really be much better .  the beginning is captivating but slow , the middle is fantastic , and the ending is not only shallow but worse than that , it drags ( the final half hour not only does it not bring the story to any real conclusion , it could probably stop at any point ) .  and did anyone really figure out what the mystery is that arthur unearths ?  it almost seems like there was no point in the entire investigation other than to unearth the past , which is commendable but not totally so .  still , it does what the oliver stone pic " the doors " didn't do right , becoming very insightful to what happened , using the visual style to hit most of the right notes of contrast between what made the era so great to those who lived during it and why after living through such an era that everything else seems half-assed ( i suppose the message is : " live life , but after you've lived it , what else is the point when you'll be forced to live with regretful memories ? " ) .  the really superb achievement of this film is that during its flashbacks , it successfully creates for the audience what it must have felt like to be in that era , but with the added perk of knowing the result of all that goes down . 
neg@ pos neg the sequel to the fugitive ( 1993 ) , u . s marshals is an average thriller using it's association with the fugitive just so it can make a few extra bucks .  tommy lee jones returns to his role as chief deputy samuel gerard , the grizzly cop who was after harrison ford in the fugitive .  this time , he's after fugitive mark sheridan ( snipes ) who the police think killed two fbi agents , but of course he's been set up , and when the police plane escort he ( and gerard ) are riding crashes , he makes a run for it , gerard not so hot on his tail .  what follows is about 2 hours of action , brought to us by the director of executive decision ( 1995 ) , another film curiously involving a plane .  when comparing this movie to the fugitive , the prequel is far superior .  but even on it's own , u . s marshals is a pretty lousy movie .  while the original was reasonably intelligent , and had a fugitive to root for , the audience feels strangely distanced from snipes fugitive , mainly because we know so little about him until way into the film's overlong running time .  while the fugitive gave a little time to develop harrison fords character , u . s marshals is straight in there , pulling it's trump card ( the place crash ) almost immediately .  to be honest , i couldn't care less if snipe's character got captured or not .  snipes performance is average , and his character gets surprisingly little screen time ( considering he is the fugitive ) for reasons i'll explain later .  tommy lee jones is as fine as ever , although his role is hardly a challenge .  the sense of deja vu was overwhelming .  i know it's the same role from the fugitive , but there is seemingly no attempt to develop his character from the last film .  there's a few 'nudge nudge' references from the first film , but apart from that , nothing .  nobody even mentions harrison ford in this movie .  downey jnr is ok as fbi agent john royce who's roped into the chase , and sexy french actress irene jacob wanders in and out of the movie as snipes wife .  nobody looks as if their having a good time , and all the performers are on autopilot .  the supporting cast are o . k , but when it comes to performances , u . s marshals falls flat on it's face .  it doesn't fare any better plot-wise , either .  the film starts off with gerard trying to capture snipes , but then veers off into terrorists territory .  as said above , the film is an normal , average terrorist thriller , seen a million times before , but is using the fugitive reputation to make it sound more professional .  if this film wasn't the 'sequel' to the fugitive , this would probably go straight to video , or not even been made at all , because it's so average .  and because of the film's plot changing it's course , snipes is almost forgotten apart , and hardly features in the movie .  stuart baird , the director , is all right , but there's no particular scene that stands out .  it's director is the usual action movie style .  even the plane crash is sorely lacking in tension .  the special effects are nice , especially the plane crash , and there's a good ( if very loud ) soundtrack by veteran composer jerry goldsmith .  but in the end , u . s marshals suffers from an overwhelmingly lack of excitement .  sure , it's loud and dumb , but in the end u . s marshals just ain't fun .  bored performers and a lackluster plot and script , do not make a good action movie .  overall rating= review by david wilcock web space provided by geocities 
pos@ pos neg  " love is the devil " is a challenging film , munundating its audience with wild imagery and a plot structure that disallows a plot , perhaps in an attempt to get us to know the artist's psyche rather than the artist's lifeline .  watching it , i was enthralled with the look of the film , the way the director shot everything like it was looking through a bizarre , personalized filter .  everything looks like it is not how life looks like but how painter francis bacon , the film's subject , looked at it personally .  but while i was engrossed , i stumbled upon my thoughts halfway through the film , awakened from my trance by some inner distraction , and began to try and follow what's going on .  exactly what was i looking at ?  watching this film , i wasn't sure if it was the most insightful film i had ever seen or the most vacuous .  directed ( and written ) by john maybury , " love is the devil " is stylish masterpiece for the senses .  everything looks originally bizarre and perplexing .  the camera angles are ferociously askew , and the close-ups are uncomfortably too close .  the editing is deft , occasionally cutting away to something bizarre every couple seconds , but other times holding on a shot for so long that you wonder if the audience is not supposed to be voyeurs , or rather , intruders to bacon's world and psyche .  as such , there is no real story .  i've not heard much about francis bacon that i didn't read prior to the film , but what i learned was this : he was a painter in england who reached his peak during the 60s and 70s , drawing hideously bizarre drawings of carnage and the like .  he was one of the first to really come out of the closet , and in interviews , he was notoriously drunk yet incredibly witty .  as played by great shakesperean actor derek jacobi , he's like a foppish and self-absorbed cross between oscar wilde and nero .  he lives life the way he wants to live it , to the disatisfaction of those who have the privelege of being really close to him .  it's as if he were taking delight in the destruction of others and maybe himself ( " champagne for my real friends , and pain for my sham friends , " he says one night at the bar he frequents ) .   " love is the devil " chronicles the latter part of his life .  bacon , well-known in his mid-life , awakens one night when he hears a man tumble through his ceiling window and land on the floor .  he walks in , unafraid of what he finds , and discovers a thief , george dyer ( daniel craig ) .  bacon gives him an offer : if he spends the night with him , he can take anything he wants in the morning .  george agrees to this , and off to bed he goes , but ends up staying with him , for whatever reason .  the film shows their lives together , at least in reference to one another .  while creating bacon's world of friends ( like " high art , " this film minors in showing a certain group of people who radiate a connection that is not shown but is understood ) , the film shows the relationship of bacon and george as it remains rather stagnant .  bacon is haughty and bizarre ; george is simple and doesn't understand bacon in the least , especially not his paintings .  while watching this , that's basically all i thought was there .  the film has a hypnotic feel , free of any restraints of form , and is shot so uniquely that i felt my attention was almost entirely on the way this film was made rather than what it is about .  once the film is over , it's easier to piece it together .  i kept on thinking about this film , wondering what the point to all of it was .  someone doesn't merely make a film of all style and no substance at all , and if they do , they do it by accident , but still allow some substance to creep in .  thinking about it , i remembered how the two fed off of eachother .  i thought about how bacon was a masochist , in love with cruelty ( in one scene , he watches a boxing match with a orgiastic delight , and lets out a squeal of pleasure when blood from the one boxer's head splashes across his face ; in another scene , he masturbates to the odessa steps sequence of eisenstein's " battleship potemkin " ) , and perhaps he drove george too far in his delight for pain .  he drove him over the edge , and for him that was love , even if it wasn't for george .  i guess that explains the title .  a bit .  that's great and all , but i almost wish the film was devoid of any meaning .  i wish it hadn't reduced itself to making some point about humanity , about how love is the most selfish thing in the world ( and it is , if you look at it a certain way ) .  or maybe if it had avoided any meaning about humanity and merely drove itself into being the one film that was truly inside one man's twisted pysche .  it's almost always best to obtain insights from looking at one man's uniqueness than it is forcing universality down an audience's throat .  that way you don't reduce your film to something it's just not .  i can't say i totally enjoyed " love is the devil , " though .  despite all of the things i respect about this movie , it's still rather uncomfortable to sit through .  even at a normally trite length of ninety minutes , the film still seems like an arduous task to sit through , especially after an exhausting first hour .  though hypnotic , it still almost seems gimmicky and even redundant at times , as if it were taking advantage of one man's truly bizarre nature but not doing anything deeper with it .  as such , i respect the way the film looks .  it's beautiful and painstakingly crafted so that , along with " what dreams may come " and " dark city , " it's the year's most visually stunning film .  in fact , if a better script had been forged , i'd almost compare it in visual power to a peter greenaway film , complete with similar haunting images that stick in the mind forever .  and with a dymanite performance by derek jacobi , it has the comic and distanced tone that it needs .  i just wish it had been more than mostly style and just a hair bit of substance .  then i would have had something to hold me over even now . 
neg@ pos neg  " some houses are born bad , " goes the haunting's tag line , to which i must add , " some movies , too . "  nothing short of hiring a new cast , a more literate screenwriter , and a new director could have saved this tragically misguided adaptation of jackson's meritorious novel .  the haunting is late entry summer dreck too slick to be creepy , and its seemingly endless stream of digital trickery and spooky ooky sound effects don't frighten so much as numb the audience into submission-the film is like a rube goldberg contraption rigged to shout " boo . "  fragile nell ( taylor ) , bisexual theo ( zeta-jones ) , and smiley luke ( wilson ) are three insomniacs who gather at the reputedly possessed hill house for an extended study on sleep disorders , hosted by professor marrow ( neeson ) .  marrow's secretly gathering data on their respective paranoid responses to his recount of hill house's bleak history .  he's not prepared for the very real apparitions that terrorize the crew , nell especially , who has some ancestral connection to the manor's previous inhabitants .  taylor is thoroughly insufferable in her first big-budget lead .  for starters , her consistently dour expression sucks the life out of even the early scenes , when we're introduced to the mansion and all its fun-house trappings .  her character is supposed to be depressed , having tended to an unloving mother for too many years , but taylor plays nell as supernaturally lame , alternately grouchy , mopey , wiggy and pathetic , and i kept wondering why the other characters didn't just ditch this bitch .  as for the obscenely photogenic zeta-jones , she breezes through her scenes with a wink and a smile and takes the scenery with her .  unfortunately , she's saddled with some of the most unlikely dialogue the screenplay has to offer .  theo's assessment of the house ?   " i love it !  sort of charles foster kane meets the munsters . "  who on earth would say that in place of " citizen kane meets the munsters " ?   ( furthermore , would you gladly spend a single night in a house befitting that description ? )  both actresses fare better than neeson , who looks embarrassed to be a part of this ensemble ( and for good reason ) , and his character is the most bland .  as luke puts it , dr . marrow pulls the old " academic bait and switch " on his subjects , but he breaks down and confesses to this the second he's accused .  later , he risks his life by climbing a crumbling stairwell to save nell ( it's amusing to hear neeson shout " nell " repeatedly , given his starring role in the 1994 jodie foster vehicle of the same name ) .  why was this nice , helpful , and redemptive researcher so absent of ethics at the start ?  the haunting was well designed by eugenio zanetti .  his sets are obsessively detailed , and even before the cgi kicks in , they seem alive , never quite still .  i do have one beef with this aspect of the production : the real life mansion used in exterior shots , nottinghamshire's harlaxton manor , is so vast that one has trouble believing that nell and company , no matter how much running away they do from ghosts and goblins , always finish up in locations that were established in act one , as if all the action has been confined to one wing of hill house .  eighty million dollars was spent on the haunting , and despite a powerhouse box office debut , i doubt it will recoup its costs ( including marketing ) domestically .  thank jan de bont for that : proving for the third time that speed was a fluke , in that it was actually enjoyable , de bont has served up another ride , sans thrill .  his images , well-lit though they are , have an unmistakable been there-done that quality ; in fact , whole sequences , not to mention the cloaked , airy ghoul who owns the climax , feel lifted from a much smarter and infinitely more enjoyable spectacle from three summers back , peter jackson's the frighteners .  i don't mean to suggest de bont is a plagiarist , i mean to suggest that he's a hack , having found no new ways to give us chills . 
pos@ pos neg to me , nicolas cage sounds like an ideal choice for the lead role in a martin scorsese film .  despite the rantings that sean penn so rudely expressed , the actor remains a gifted and versatile screen presence .  ever since the big success of the action-thriller `face/off' in 1997 , the hollywood road has been a rocky one for mr . cage .  the perpetually awful assassination thriller `snake eyes' was one of 1998's worst films .  `8mm' was a disappointing lost cause .  but who better than scorsese to match cage's wit and intensity , which he does in miraculous fashion with `bringing out the dead' .  cage delivers one of his finest performances as frank pierce , a new york city emergency paramedic who is running on fumes from day-to-day .  after five years of the stress-inducing job , frank basically just staggers onward , relying on heavy doses of caffeine and booze until his shift finally ends .  he also begins seeing the ghosts of past patients who died under his care , namely a young girl named rose , who stares back at him with pale features at every street corner in new york .  frank desperately wants to be fired , but his boss needs him to scour the city and help those in need ( `i'll fire you tomorrow . . . ' he promises ) .  frank is accompanied by a fresh face every night in the ambulance .  the first is larry ( john goodman ) , who always has food on the brain .  the second is marcus ( ving rhames ) , a deeply religious black man who incorporates the power of jesus into a regular rescue operation .  and finally , tom ( tom sizemore ) is a deranged sociopath hungry for blood .  i found it unique how scorsese used each of these characters for a single shift with frank , but they never figured into the actual plot .  each is merely a colorful presence to help develop frank's character , because `bringing out the dead' is predominantly a study of his mind and detailed personality .  the one character alongside frank that truly comes into play is mary ( patricia arquette ) , the daughter of a newly admitted patient who suffered from a severe heart attack .  arquette , who recently received the wounds of christ in `stigmata' , performs well around real-life husband cage .  it's unfortunate that , after such intriguing character trials and tribulations , the relationship between frank and mary slips during a mishandled , ineffective finale .  the movie belongs to the one-two punch of cage and scorsese , who were born to collaborate their efforts in an arrangement similar to `bringing out the dead' .  although it certainly lacks the grit and hard-edge of something like `goodfellas' , scorsese manages to hit a nerve with his latest picture .  the incredible camera-work and photography represent stunning flashes of brilliance in an otherwise unspectacular conglomeration .  fans will be pleased to find the director has returned to his abrasive , darkly humorous roots after somewhat of a departure with 1997's `kundun' .  does `bringing out the dead' rival scorsese's finest work ?  only occasionally .  some of the film feels surprisingly limp , but there is enough energy in it's interesting material and breathtaking visual appearance to suffice .  those expecting a grisly , risqu ? product may be somewhat disheartened at the fairly straight-arrow approach - but it's still a solid , admirable effort .  `bringing out the dead' was written by the acclaimed paul schrader , who collaborated with scorsese on such classics as `taxi driver' and `raging bull' .  schrader's script is full of moments - wonderful , sharply defined moments - that are sorted throughout the remainder of his meandering screenplay .  the exceptional aspects of the film are it's astounding technical credits and the amazing cast .  goodman and sizemore are both electric ( well , mainly sizemore ) , but it's the phenomenal ving rhames who deserves a second look .  watch the actor's deeply inspired dedication as he resurrects a gothic band member , and you'll understand why he won a golden globe .  `bringing out the dead' is raw and electrifying often enough to mask it's certain flaws .  scorsese - and cage , for that matter - have done better , but their intentions are certainly admirable . 
neg@ pos neg synopsis : wealthy cuban landowner luis ( banderas ) gets more than he bargained for when he sends away for an american bride .  not only does his new wife turn out to be the beautiful julia ( jolie ) , she also harbours a secret past of dubious merit .  soon , julia has absconded with both luis' fortune and his heart , and as he pursues his wife through the cuban underworld , luis begins to realise that , for him , there is no turning back .  review : given the absurdism of its would-be plot , it's unlikely that " original sin " could have been turned into a reputable piece of filmmaking , regardless of writer , director or stars .  this is , at its heart , b-movie junk : a lurid melodrama which appeals to neither the brain nor the heart but to the nether regions .  that said , " original sin " could at least have become enjoyable junk had the filmmakers embraced its trashiness and indulged in it .  instead , cristofer seems to have mistaken this for a serious production , and directs it as such .  the result is a vapid , uninteresting morass of obvious crosses and double crosses , as likely to incite a yawn as a thrill .  consider the initial sex scene between banderas and jolie : brightly-lit and mostly filmed from above , it looks like an excerpt from an amateur soft porn show .  cristofer doesn't even manage to capture the allure of cuba ; instead of portraying his setting as a steamy , sensuous island paradise , it appears bland and lifeless .  at least banderas and jolie manage to inspire some interest ; there are hints at times that they want to have more fun with the script , but aren't being given the chance .  the same cannot be said of jane , whose billy is nebbish and transparent .  also unwise is the jolie framing sequence , which practically gives away the film's denouement . 
pos@ pos neg david cronenberg presents us with another strange tale crawling out of his impressively twisted head .  it is one of many science fiction films , released during the last year of this millenium , that tackles issues that will play an important role in our future .  the story unfolds in a near future , where the line between reality and virtual reality blurs .  the world of the future is an unfriendly place , where the scared inhabitants are " hiding " in virtual reality fantasy games to escape the uncertainty of the real world .  allegra geller ( jennifer jason leigh ) , the leading game designer in the world , is testing her new virtual reality game , existenz with a focus group .  as they begin , she is attacked by a fanatic assassin employing a bizarre organic gun .  she flees with a young marketing trainee , ted pikul ( jude law ) , who is suddenly assigned as her bodyguard .  unfortunately , her pod , an organic gaming device that contains the only copy of the existenz game program , is damaged .  to inspect it , she talks ted into accepting a gameport in his own body so he can play the game with her .  the events leading up to this , and the resulting game lead the pair on a strange adventure in a world where individuality doesn't exist , as the " players " are forced to perform as characters in an unknown plot .  here the reality and their actions are impossible to determine from either their own or the game's perspective .  i don't intend to reveal more of the film's premise , which is structured as a computer game , with " tasks " that the characters must complete to win the game .  released after " the matrix " and " dark city " , " existenz " has some similarities and parallels that connect it to these films .  however , " existenz " is moving in a different direction , with a premise of its own .  a combination of dazzling special effects , brilliantly coordinated action sequences and an intelligent and sophisticated plot , made " the matrix " a rare and entertaining science fiction experience , with some dark and frightening ideas hidden under its sparkling facade .   " existenz " has a completely different atmosphere , resembling " dark city " , which is darker , more serious and less entertaining .   " existenz " has the opportunities and potential , but the enormous possibilities are never quite explored .  after the engaging beginning , it starts to falter .  while i was watching the film , many left the theatre during the first hour .  and indeed , " existenz " seemed as a complete failure : the actors seemed unreal , the plot and dialogue silly , unfinished relationships and unexplained events followed one after another .  but the last fifteen minutes lifted the film on a complete different level , explaining all past events , the silly dialogue and the unreal performances within a few scenes .  and jet the film fails on several issues .  probably the best written character in the story is a game designer , who would rather spend the rest of her life in a virtual world , than face real life .  this is a great possibility to create a magnificent character , and jennifer jason leigh stretches cronenberg's script to the limits , but fails because the advantages of virtual reality in comparison to the real world are never shown .  existenz is not a world of which you might dream about in your fantasies .  it is not a world worth sacrificing your life for .  it's a cold , dark place where the " players " are forced to interrelate with unreal characters , eat mutated creatures and even murder against their own will .  it doesn't look like a place worth even thinking about .  david cronenberg has been the creator of " the fly " , " videodrome " and " the dead zone " , so it's not so hard to guess that " existenz " is a violent and gory film .  besides the regular murders of innocent people , the audiences can enjoy an autopsy of a two-headed mutated amfibium .  scenes like that have become a trademark for cronenberg and it seems that he can't make a film without flowing blood and foul creatures .  the way i see it , this is the film's crucial failure .  it is impossible for cronenbergto create a beautiful world where time , space and problems of our everyday life do not exist ; a place of blooming blossoms , green forests and clear waters ; a place really worth sacrificing your life for .  because of its lack of three dimensionality , the film looses most of its possibilities , but stays afloat because of some interesting scenes , amusing performances ( especially by willem dafoe ) and one interesting and important thought , depicted in many different ways throughout the movie .  during the film , the audience is as confused as the characters : detached from their everyday existence and no longer able to see the difference between the real world and the alternative reality that they have created .   " the matrix " , despite of its many dark and disturbing thoughts , ends with a light at the end of the tunnel .   " existenz " does not .  it is a one time experience , ending in blood , gore and madness - a rather frightening forecast for tomorrow . 
neg@ pos neg play it to the bone , the newest addition to ron shelton's sports - themed repertoire fails in numerous ways .  like most of shelton's other great films ( bull durham , white men can't jump ) , this dud unsuccessfully attempts to use athleticism as a method of connecting characters and creating interesting subplots .  shelton's films are not considered sports films , but they do heavily revolve around a specific game to tell a story .  shelton has been so good in the past at using sports to analyze the structure of society that from his collection of films we are given an examination of different classes and races living in various different regions .  play it to the bone is unsuccessful because not only is the boxing theme dull , but the side story of the two guys and a girl travelling across the country is even worse .  the film has no social message like its predecessors .  the relationship between the friends , two failed boxers who must face off against each other in the ring for 50 thousand dollars , is very confusing for a number of reasons .  the whole film , since it is primarily a " buddy picture , " depends on the strength of the friendship the two characters have for each other .  unfortunately , it is a very weak bond for the reasons listed below .  1 ) we never see how cesar ( antonio banderas ) and vince ( woody harrelson ) meet .  the two are so different from each other , that a scene of how this odd friendship developed should have been mandatory .  2 ) vince and cesar argue every moment possible on their trip to las vegas .  there is not one convincing moment dedicated to seeing the characters laugh together or actually agree on something .  3 ) the third character on the trip , grace ( lolita davidovich ) stands in the way .  she is in nearly every scene with them , making it impossible to understand the difficulty the two male characters are going to have when they fight each other .  4 ) there are two many interfering , irrelevant side stories .  vince is convinced that he sees jesus on a regular basis , cesar yells at the sky in spanish when he is angry , and grace tries to sell her inventions to hotel owner robert wagner .  these boring tales only hurt the central plot .  5 ) when it comes to time for the two men to fight , they don't even hesitate to pound each other .  wasn't the whole point of the road trip to show that these two are friends who could never hurt each other ?  by the time the road trip part of the movie is over with , the film wants to be over .  shelton , on the other hand , continues to tell his story .  forty five painful minutes remain .  the boxing scene between cesar and vince starts out very powerful and interestingly different from other boxing movies .  however , the fight goes on for way too long and becomes very repetitive and predictable after awhile , kind of like the whole film . 
pos@ pos neg at first glance , it appears that the home alone movies are brainless slapstick intended for those with minds of 8-year olds .  that's true of home alone 2 and i'd bet money that it's true of home alone 3 ( opening soon ) .  but home alone actually has a lot going for it , and the cartoon slapstick doesn't get in the way .  the mcalisters , all 15 of them , are going to france for the holidays .  four adults and eleven kids are spending the night together before heading to the airport en masse .  the littlest kid , kevin , is the victim of the older kids' cruelty .  kevin's patience runs out when he learns that his plain-cheese pizza has already been eaten , and he's going to have to starve .  he attacks his big bully brother buzz , who had been teasing him .  the fight disrupts the already-chaotic dinner , spilling milk and soft drinks all over the table , a few cousins , and an uncle .  the knee-jerk reaction is for everyone to blame kevin .  nobody came to his rescue when he was being teased , but they all point their fingers when he fights back .  the ultimate punishment comes from mom ( catherine o'hara ) who sends him up to the spare bedroom in the attic for the night .  on his way up the stairs , he tells her that " families suck " and that he hopes never to see any of his family again .  that night the power goes out , knocking out the alarm clocks , so the mcalisters wake up in a big hurry to get to the airport .  in a surprisingly plausible setup , kevin is mistakenly accounted for , and the family heads off without him .  it's interesting that , in a subtle way , his parents never noticed him missing because of their deliberate desire to separate themselves from their children .  first they delegate the headcount to an older sibling , and second , they put all the kids in coach while they fly first class .  they're two-thirds of the way across the atlantic before they realize they are missing a child .  meanwhile , kevin believes that somehow his wish has come true .  he's finally rid of his family !  life is a dream come true .  he can jump on the beds , watch r-rated movies , eat gobs of ice cream and potato chips , and dig through his big brother's secret box .  slowly , the novelty wears off and he settles into the mundane .  he grooms himself , he does the laundry , he goes shopping ( " i bought some milk , eggs , and fabric softener " ) .  he also starts to miss his family , not just for their company , but for the security they bring .  the furnace in the basement is a scary monster , the old man next door is a snow-shovel murderer , and two crooks are trying to break into his house .  macaulay culkin is cute but he isn't much of an actor .  still , we can see that kevin's character grows , thanks to some good direction and editing .  for example , acting has little to do with the emotional impact of the scene where kevin searches out a seasonal santa at night , just as " santa " is getting in his car .  kevin asks the man to pass on his request - he wants his family back - to the real santa .  he learned how to deal with the furnace .  you turn on the lights and it's not so scary anymore .  he goes to a church one evening and there he sees the snow-shovel murderer , who actually turns out to be a nice man .  they talk about their fears and kevin learns that age alone does not make you less afraid .  finally , in the last 20 minutes , kevin confronts his last fear - the bandits , head on ( literally ) .  this last act is full of violent comedic slapstick , and after the movie's genuine dramatic setup , it is dessert .  it's a lot of fun , and it doesn't overwhelm the rest of the movie .  on the whole , home alone is a great holiday movie .  john williams' original score has the sound and feel of holiday music without the disadvantage of being overplayed at the malls , and the christmas setting can put you in the mood for those family gatherings .  but it does have its flaws .  the smallest problem is that culkin doesn't act very well .  as i said before , he is cute , but repeated viewings reveal more about how columbus covered himself than about culkin's insight into his character .  the biggest problem is that during the cartoony coda , the villains threaten kevin's life about five times .  instead of " i'm gonna get that kid " they say " i'm gonna kill that kid . "  some might argue that the tone is the same , but i strongly disagree .  mixing comedy with specific and viable threats of murder is a sociopathic faux-pas .  i'll probably never see home alone 3 , and i wish i had skipped home alone 2 , but i do enjoy home alone almost every year .  don't let your impressions of the others detract from the original , which has much more to offer than cartoon slapstick . 
neg@ pos neg 200 cigarettes takes place on new year's eve 1981 .  monica , played by martha plimpton is having a huge new year's party .  everyone in town is trying to get there , but some are caught up in other things .  this is the basic plot of 200 cigarettes .  as we meet the characters headed towards the party , we are sent into many subplots which are unoriginal , and not interesting at all .  this disappointed me greatly .  the film should have been more about the party than the people trying to get there in my opinion .  lucy , played by courtney love , is with kevin , played by paul rudd .  the two are in a relationship that is more of a friendship , but starts to blossom into something more than that .  this subplot is extremely boring and dull , and i am getting quite sick of plots like that .  janeane garofalo is involved in another subplot , dealing with kevin .  she plays ellie , an ex-girlfriend of kevin's .  this subplot is completely a waste of garofalo's talent .  there was no point to it at all , and it was hardly even in the movie .  when lucy runs into a bartender , played by ben affleck , another subplot is formed .  the bartender is invited by lucy to come to monica's party .  at the bar , he runs into two more girls .  the girls are played by angela featherstone and nicole parker , but unfortunately , due to the terrible acting of both of them , i don't even remember their characters names .  ben affleck is a good actor , but his character doesn't go anywhere so he doesn't have much screen time to give a good performance .  featherstone and parker are horrible in their roles , and they are part of the reason the film is so bad .  christina ricci plays val , and gaby hoffman plays stephie .  the two girls are trying to get to the party but are extremely lost .  they meet some guys and end up going around with them all night .  this subplot was alright , but it was quite annoying with stephie's accent .  hoffman did an okay job of acting , but ricci did good .  she was underused , considering she is such a wonderful actress .  another subplot in the film is the relationship between cindy , played by goldie hawn's daughter , and jack , played by jay mohr .  jack is an actor who doesn't care about the girls he goes out with , he just likes dates for one night , and the next day he doesn't .  kate hudson is a huge klutz .  she gets herself into very funny situations , that are the funniest parts in the entire movie .  they are probably the only funny parts in the entire movie as well .  this subplot could have been used more , mainly due to hudson's performance .  mohr wasn't good , but he wasn't bad .  he was just alright , which i didn't find acceptable .  there is not much to say about the performances in the film .  none of the characters are developed or shown enough to really tell if the acting is good or not .  the only performances that i can judge are christina ricci's as always good performance , kate hudson's funny role , courtney love's mediocre performance , and paul rudd's annoying and overused performance .  i was hoping for a little more out of jaw mohr , ben affleck , casey affleck , gaby hoffman , dave chapelle , and especially out of janeane garofalo .  the two strongest things in the film were the great soundtrack and the original costumes .  martha plimpton and christina ricci had very different and original outfits which made me feel like i was in the year 1981 .  the soundtrack is full of 1980's tunes , ranging from " i want candy " to " tainted love . "  the songs in the movie also helped create the feel that you were back in the 1980s .  during the film , i often found myself asking the questions , " is there a reason to this ?  is there any moral story ?  is there a point ?  are any of the events going on in the film necessary ?  do i care what lucy and kevin are going through ? "  the movie is extremely boring , and by the time they reached eleven-o-clock , one hour before midnight , i could not wait for the movie to be over .  the plot is okay , but the subplots make it terrible .  maybe if the film was about the party , not about the people at the party , it could have been a lot better .  the bottom line : just like a slasher movie , this ? 80s comedy is just one too many . 
pos@ pos neg a wonderful little movie that is really interested in its characters and in its theme .  the scene of " second best " is laid in wales .  james ( chris cleary miles ) is a 10-year-old boy who must live in a home because his father ( keith allen ) is in prison and his mother committed suicide .  james is a mentally unbalanced child .  he can't forget what happened in the past , and he dreams of living a happy life with his beloved father .  in the home he feels sadly and lonely .  one day , a social worker ( alan cumming ) tells him of a person who wants to adopt him .  this person is graham holt ( william hurt ) .  graham manages a post office and shop in a village .  he is a single and hasn't any real friends .  his mother is dead , and his father is ill and will die .  graham feels that he has been a disappointment to his parents .  there has never been real love between his parents and him .  graham's monotonous life would get a new sense if he could adopt james .  but graham has not only to convince the institutions , but must also win the love of james .  james and graham have to open theirselves .  they must get to know each other and learn to understand and trust the other person .  james and graham aid each other to cope with their problems .  but will their relationship really have a future ?   " second best " is based on a novel by david cook who also wrote the screenplay .  the film was directed by chris menges who had made his directing debut with the very good anti-apartheid drama " a world apart " ( 1987/88 ) .  and maybe , " second best " is even a greater picture .  this precise , richly detailed , sensitively and convincingly directed study about a special adoption treats its theme with great seriousness .  the breathtakingly intense film shows the necessity of human contact and communication .  william hurt delivers an outstanding performance as graham holt .  and chris cleary miles is remarkably convincing in the role of the boy .  the supporting cast is also fine ( especially jane horrocks as debbie , a social worker who is charged to examine graham's living circumstances ) .   " second best " is an underestimated masterpiece .  it's a pity that films like this one are made so seldom .  i eagerly await menges' next directorial work , " the lost son " , which will star daniel auteuil .

pos@ pos neg summary five liberal iowa graduate students share a house and carry on a tradition of a large sunday dinner .  for a year now they have been inviting a guest for dinner and discussion .  on this occasion one of the roommates , pete ( ron eldard ) , brings home a stranger who picked him up when his car broke down .  the stranger is zack ( bill paxton ) who appears like a decent enough good samaritan .  nothing could be further from the truth .  after some dinner conversation it appears that zack is , among other things , a racist " you know my grandfather once said that if he knew you coloreds were going to be so much trouble we'd have picked the damn cotton ourselves " , and an anti-semite .  an argument escalates at the dinner table and leads to violence .  after zack assaults marc ( jonathan penner ) and pete , zack is killed .  the roommates are at odds with what to do .  marc , pete and paulie ( annabeth gish ) immediately wish to call the police .  luke ( courtney b . vance ) and jude ( cameron diaz ) suggest something different .  after more discussion they agree to dispose of the body and cover it up .  they do not want to be sent to jail for what they feel was a justifiable homicide .  when it is done the roommates realize that it was easier than they thought .  so easy in fact that they decide that every sunday their dinner guest would be someone who opposes of their views .  if they all agree that the guest deserves to die , they will poison them and bury them in the back yard .  the back yard fills up rather quickly , its' victims including ( among others ) a right to life extremist , an anti-environmentalist and a homophobe .  by the time the roommates get to their tenth victim they begin to question their methods .  are they giving the guests a chance ?  are they even giving them good food anymore ?  this film is what i like to call a " hidden treasure " .  this film is such a pleasant surprise .  a well written , devilish satire that is funny , sexy and original .  this film should be a hit , but i guess the fact that it apparently had no marketing wouldn't give it much of a chance .  i had never heard of it until i saw a copy at my video store .  stacy title does a wonderful job directing .  she somehow finds the time to give all of the characters enough screen time to develop a distinct personality .  >from the five members of the house to other key characters including sheriff stanley ( nora dunn ) , the local law closing in on the truth , and the dream dinner guest , norman arbuthnot ( ron perlman ) , a rush limbaugh clone who should be the roommates easiest kill .  perlman gives the films' best performance .  he finds the right note as the right wing big mouth who simultaneously offends and gains followers , and may just inadvertently talk his way out of death .  the other actors are convincing as well , as all of the roommates deal with their murderous ways .  some of the characters appear to be heading down the road towards insanity , while others grieve their decisions .  when friends ask me to recommend a movie , this is usually the first one i think of .  i am not saying that this is my favorite movie ( although it is in my top ten ) , but because the film was such a wonderful surprise , i have a fondness for it .  i also try to recommend films like this : ones that have not been seen by many people , but should . 
neg@ pos neg synopsis : the president of a company wants to test his self-appointed successor , who's psychotic , and thinks it's a great idea to spend a week with him and their wives in an isolated cabin a hundred miles from civilization with no dependable transportation or means of communication after a heavy snowfall .  comments : tracks of a killer had a couple of strikes against it before i even began watching it .  strike one was the fact that someone had scrawled the word garbage on the videotape's sticker in black marker ( not typically a good sign when you rent a film ) .  strike two came while the previews played .  did you ever get a sinking premonition about a movie's quality ( or lack thereof ) while watching the trailers that come before it ?  well , the cheesy films being advertised before tracks of a killer were films that no one has ever heard of starring people no one knows , and they all looked bad ( definately not a good sign ) .  tracks of a killer itself completed the strikeout .  about the only positive thing this film had going for it was the fact that it sports some nice scenery .  to be fair , the first half-hour or so promises at least a watchable thriller .  wolf larson , who bears more than a passing resemblance to hugh grant , adequately plays the underling obviously set up as the killer of the film's title .  james brolin and kelly lebrock seem equally adequate as the loving couple larson will later threaten .  brolin's character , for some inexplicable reason , thinks its a great idea to spend some time in a cabin , practically isolated , with lebrock and larson , whom he's decided to test for the week before giving him full control of his company .  by the time the characters arrive at the cabin , this film begins to become tedious .  apparently , brolin's successor's test involves chopping wood for the fireplace and skiing , which don't seem like attributes necessary to run a business in the city .  but , then again , what do i know about business ?  i do think , though , that they should have invested in some better furniture for the cabin ; its beds and closets have a habit of just breaking at the slightest touch .  larson's character accidently kills his own wife rather than the couple he wants to kill .  this leaves the movie with an hour to go and only three characters , which really isn't enough to sustain it .  the film's writer must have taken a cue from stephen king , as scenes from tracks of a killer seem lifted out of misery and gerald's game .  larson and lebrock fight and torture each other ( the tables get turned a couple of times ) while brolin tramps around in the snow looking for help .  some old guy's around too , just so the killer can add to his body count without killing the couple , who everyone knows will be alive at the end of the film .  the old guy , however , miraculously survives his first death and appears later to be killed again by the killer in a scene so ludicrous it's worthy of a chuckle or two .  outside of that chuckle , unfortunately , tracks of a killer will just bore you as the obvious plot is drawn out ad infinitum and the actors , for some reason , become increasing obnoxious .  if you're in a video store and thinking about renting this turkey , don't .  make tracks to a far superior suspense film , like misery . 
pos@ pos neg sam ( matthew broderick ) is an astronomer in a small american town and engaged to teacher linda ( kelly preston ) .  he is head over heels in love and lindas sudden departure to new york city to live with her new lover anton ( tch ? ky karyo ) comes as a complete surprise to him .  but as we all know love is blind and so sam leaves for new york as well to win her back .  he moves into an abandoned house across the street from anton's apartment and installs a camera obscura to watch them .  suddenly anton's ex maggie shows up , but she does not want her former lover back .  on the contrary , all she wants to do is vaporize him .  she may say that she doesn't want to kill him , but the possibility doesn't bother her too much either .  after all , people die every day .  in spite of their different motives the two team up and fall for each other as things move on .  the story sounds like something we all have seen a million times .  but we haven't .  griffin dunne brings us the most charming comedy since " while you where sleeping " .  the camera obscura adds a " special something " to the movie and makes it an exceptional romantic comedy .  everything about the movie is perfect , from set design to casting .  the dialogues are inspired and the touches of black humor add a certain bite .  meg ryan , known from " when harry met sally " or " sleepless in seattle " , surprises in a role that may finally help her get rid of her sweet little girl image .  she impresses the viewer as a maneating biker girl .  even more surprising is the fact that the viewer believes her , much more so than in last years " courage under fire " where she played a gulf war pilot .  matthew broderick is the goodnatured and somewhat naive sam who has trouble accepting reality .  the viewer can tell that he doesn't only watch the stars but also tries to reach out for them .  he has trouble keeping in touch with reality .  after all , who would leave everything behind to chase a lost love ?  his naivet ? that we don't question for a minute throughout the movie clashes with maggies exaggerated wish for revenge .  she would do anything to harm anton .  she doesn't hesitate to use sam for her plan and makes him understand right from the beginning that nothing will happen between the two of them .  that makes the scenes when they innocently share a bed , have potatoe chips and watch the action across the street like a saturday night show on tv even funnier .  tch ? ky karyo is perfect as anton .  he is , well , repulsive .  that's all there is to say about him .  you can't really manage to pity him , even after all his mishaps .  he not only took sam's bride away from him , he is also a french chef .  worlds collide , i .  e .  the usa and france .  this can only go wrong .  even if maggies revenge schemes are at times shocking , you just can't sympathize with a man who plays " je t'aime . . . moi  non plus " on his tape deck .  not everyone is captured by the french charme that linda and even maggie fell for .  sam certainly isn't .  too bad for anton .  for him things take a turn to the worse .   " addicted to love " is one of this year's most pleasant surprises . 
neg@ pos neg this is an adaptation of h . g . wells' acclaimed novel 'the invisible man' .  the actors are kevin beacon and elizabeth shue .  the director is paul verhoven .  that , plus a quick demonstration of the amazing special effects in the trailer , should be enough to lure us into the theatre .  the problem is to keep us there .  i can't imagine anyone who would like to see this movie a second time .  working on a top secret military project , sebastian caine ( kevin beacon ) -- an eccentric genius , that calls himself " god " , has discovered the secret to invisibility .  the first two faces are completed .  now , it is time for " the next logical step " -- human .  caine volunteers for this risky experiment .  but when he is made invisible , something goes wrong .  while his ex-girlfriend linda ( elisabeth shue ) desperately tries to find something to return him to normal , he learns that invisibility is more of a prison than a superpower .  but that's not the bad thing -- an unexpected side-effect of the drug sends him careening into paranoid megalomania .  he is naturally given a couple of modest superpowers , just enough for him to survive immolation from a flame thrower and an explosion of about a quart of nitroglycerine .  soon every sense of decency is forgotten .  the little intelligence that was left disappears as verhoven looses control and the film turns into an alien-rip-off , where caine is walking like a half finished terminator , spooking , scaring and killing everybody .  though it's based on a novel called 'the invisible man' , the title has been ironically changed to 'hollow man' that sums up the film very nicely .  this is a very silly production .  laughable , actually .  apparently verhoven's imagination doesn't stretch too far .  for him the only worthwhile reason to become invisible is so you can case the girls' locker room undetected .  it is this primitive schoolboy mentality that eventually kills the movie .  being invisible , gives you the opportunity to be who you are , to do what you want without being influenced by society .  in many ways it gives you an illusion of having a life without consequences .  the nature of man and his place in society is what the novel is truly about .  all that , the depth and true horror of the book is gone and only special effects make you remain in your seat .  caine does use his power voyeuristically in hollow man .  but since this is a modernization , in other words a dehumanization , he doesn't stop there .  he becomes a rapist .  and then , of course , a murderer .  you'll start wondering why such actors as beacon and shue found themselves in such film in the first place .  shue's talent is barely seen , josh brolin is underused and the rest of the cast suffer mostly for the lack of talent .  kevin beacon is the only one that performs gracefully .  his face is not seen for the most part of the film , and the only way he exists is as a disembodied voice .  there are times when his presence actually saves the film from being completely embarrassing .  in the end the effects are the only reason to see this film in the first place .  being probably the best technical achievement since " jurassic park " , they are absolutely amazing .  we observe the layers of skin , muscle , tissue , and bone being peeled away as a body is slowly rendered invisible .  we see a beating heart , inflating lungs , and veins pulsing with newly-pumped blood .  there are a couple of inventive shots with smoke , fire , air and water , but are a few scenes like that worth attending a movie for ?  what is truly disturbing is that with a great book , talented actors and a grand budget , this could have been so much more .  pretty much like jan de bont ( " twister " , " haunting " ) , paul verhoven has never made anything extraordinary .  he was responsible for several good films ( " basic instinct " and " starship troopers ) " and some incredibly bad films ( " showgirls " , " total recall " ) , but he has never made anything that was great .  in a way " hollow man " fits perfectly in this collection .  it's not better or worse than verhoven's average film .  he proves once again that he is incapable of handling more complex issues .  and so , instead of depth and chills , verhoven inserts some of his trademarks : stupid dialogue , and lot's of dull action with blood and naked bodies .  he even throws in some of the worst of film clich ? s - the slowly advancing fireball , the villain who comes back from the dead , etc , etc . - and tops the whole thing off with one of the most ridiculous endings of the year ( you'll be screaming " nooooo ! "  and attempt to run towards the exit in slow motion ) .  and all we can ask is why ?  the answer is simple .  though hollywood is a movie producing machine , the business of moviemaking has to be about something more than money .  it has to be about telling stories , not marketing them .  it has to be about transporting us to a different place , to dazzle us with magic and cleverness .  to make us care , to make us think and feel .  verhoven has obviously missed that point and this film is a proof of that .  it's all flesh and bones , but no soul .  a void where its imagination should be . 
pos@ pos neg jacques tati's 1953 classic " les vacances de m . hulot " ( also known as " mr . hulot's vacation , " in english ) ought to be the textbook on how to do non ? dialogue comedy in film .  the characters hardly ever speak to each other directly , and the film operates on the paper ? thin premise that monsieur hulot , played by tati himself , is awkward and clumsy and generally manages to annoy the other guests at the beach resort hotel where he is taking a week's vacation .  yet the film had me beside myself laughing more consistently than any in recent memory .  part of the reason the film works so well is the clever setup for the various gags .  slapstick has often been regarded as an unsophisticated and even crude form of comedy , but i think part of the reason for this is that it often seems forced : you can only see movie characters start running after something and then crash face-first into a pole so many times before you start to wonder what all these poles are doing there in the first place or why these people don't watch where they're going .  in " les vacances de m . hulot , " the gags build upon each other and often start out relatively low-key .  in one sequence , for example , hulot is painting the side of his small row boat on the beach when , while his back is turned , the paint can gets caught up in the oncoming waves , washes away , then comes back up on the other side of the boat .  while crossing over to get the can , hulot steps in the boat and unknowingly cracks it .  when he actually takes the boat out into the water , it breaks in half , but the two halves flip up against each other , trapping him inside as the bystanders mistake it for a shark fin and panic on the beach ensues .  tati doesn't waste a single opportunity for humor ; scenes that might have yielded one joke in most comedies are good for at least four or five in this film .  it has been said that comedy relies on frustrating the audience's expectations , and " les vacances de m . hulot " succeeds brilliantly in that area as well .  tati accomplishes this largely through a sort of deadpan understatement .  when hulot goes into a separate room during dinner and starts playing a record at defeaningly loud volume , no fights or shouting matches ensue ; instead , the waiter calmly walks in and shuts off the power in the room , disconnecting the record player and leaving a puzzled hulot sitting in the dark .  tati also uses running gags to this effect , allowing them to keep running far longer than most comedy directors would ; more often than not , we can see them coming and think , " oh , he's not going to do that again , " but , lo and behold , he does .  for example , there is a recurring joke in which hulot's noisy , sputtering car engine wakes everyone in the middle of the night as an exterior shot reveals the hotel's lights coming on one by one .  then this image turns up again in the finale , which i will not give away other than to say that involves a lot more noise in the middle of the night than a car engine could ever produce .  the ending is one of two elements that really make this a four-star film as opposed to merely an above-average , clever comedy .  as much as i was laughing during this film , i was thinking to myself occasionally that tati had to top himself at the end to really make this work as a complete viewing experience ; suffice it to say that he did .  the other important aspect is that the film never seems disdainful of its characters .  it easily could have turned the tables on hulot and had the other guests exact some kind of revenge on him ; alternatively , it could have portrayed the others as humorless curmudgeons .  instead , tati seems to regard his characters with cheerful amusement more than anything else and invites the audience to like them , however strange or irritating they might seem .   " les vacances de m . hulot " is not subtitled , but the dialogue is sparse and for the most part not terribly essential to the flow of events .  anyone with a taste for this kind of absurd humor ought to make this film their next rental from the video store .  note : " les vacances de m . hulot " was not rated by the mpaa .  it would at most receive a pg rating .

"  this means that in a few months , he will die .  so what does joe do ?  quit his job , of course ! !  when he arrives home , joe meets an old man named graynamore ( lloyd bridges ) .  graynamore tells joe that in order to get some important mineral for his company from an island , the natives need someone to sacrifice to their volcano to please their fire god .  by a startling coincidence , the boat trip to the island takes a few months .  by the time he reaches the island , he will almost be dead from the " brain cloud " anyway , so joe agrees .  graynamore gives joe a credit card to buy everything he needs to go on this " great adventure " .  joe goes on a date with meg ryan , his co-worker .  the day before the boat trip , joe meets one of graynamore's daughters .  she is also , surprise , meg ryan .  except she looks more hippyish .  they both have dinner and the next day , joe gets driven over to his boat .  the lady that sails the boat is another one of graynamore's daughters .  and , wonder of wonders , she is also played by meg ryan .  as they sail to the island , meg ryan tells joe that the natives of the island have a craving for orange soda .  after some stupid talking scenes , they also deduce that graynamore had his doctor be the one that joe went to .  and that the " brain cloud " thing was made up ! !  they do plently of cheap special effects on the boat voyage .  joe goes fishing and catches a hammerhead shark .  this is a cheap gag that has been pulled off many times .  but , to top it off , the shark is obviously rubber and fake ! !  one night there is a storm .  a cheap-looking lightning bolt strikes the boat and everything is cast overboard .  fortunately , joe and meg ryan manage to find some of the luggage that joe brought to sail .  by pure luck , they get to the island .  since the natives like orange soda , they wear soda cans as attire ! !  stupid or what ?   ; ) before joe leaps in the volcano , he gets fed .  right before he jumps , meg ryan pleads him not to .  when joe decides to , she goes in with him because " she loves him " .  now this is where the movie should end .  but , unfortunately , the " cheesy ending " bug comes in .  the volcano blows the couple out and into the ocean where they land on joe's luggage .  they float to another part of the island as they watch lava pouring out of the volcano towards the villagers .  i give this movie a .  see it only if you're a film buff that enjoys a bad movie every now and then or if you really like tom hanks or meg ryan . . . 
pos@ pos neg frequency n . ,  the number of times a specified phenomenon occurs within a specified interval as the number of repetitions of a complete sequence of values of a periodic function per unit variation of an independent variable ? etc  don't worry .  when watching the thriller frequency , you won't have to know what the heck frequency means .  the premise , although it may sound complex , is very basic on the big screen .  a new york cop , john , ( jim caviezel ) finds a radio in his house , which allows him to communicate with his new york firefighter father , frank , ( dennis quaid ) who died thirty years ago .  immediately john warns his father that he will die trying to stop a fire in an abandoned warehouse .  when frank takes his advice and survives the accident he wasn't supposed to , the two eventually realize that by changing that one moment in the past , they have created a whole new future in which a serial killer murders john's mother and nine other women .  it is now up to john and frank to use their special connection and save thirty years ago to make present time a better place .   ( i told you that wasn't confusing ? ) .  overall , i was very pleased with frequency .  it's occasional sappy moments perfectly synchronized with its suspenseful serial killer scenes .  i usually don't buy those cheesy " i love you dad " segments in movies , but this one surprisingly satisfied me .  maybe because the plot is so creative and universal that i believed that this is how most people would act when talking to a dead relative .  frequency's creepy premise left me thinking once the film ended , what if ?  what would i do ?  would i help my own family or save a historical figure from being assasinated ?  or stop some kids from shooting other kids ?  or buy stock from yahoo ! ?   ( a character in the film does the latter with humorous consequences ) .  frequency also reminded me of the fantastic back to the future .  both share that " change the past slightly , and you'll change the future heavily " warning .  the changes between the present and the past , such as different newspaper headlines or people disappearing and reappearing in photographs , are very similar .  both are also wonderful feel-good family films that can attract to a number of generations .  the only difference worth noting is that frequency's final scene doesn't set up a possibility for a lucrative sequel already in the making .  there are some problems with the film though .  first , there is a major flaw in the story towards the end that is somewhat distracting ( email me if you have seen the movie and want to know what i think it is ) .  the plot must have confused even the filmmakers who frequently ( no pun intended ) switch from 1969 to 1999 while telling the story .  another problem is that the supporting cast , including noah emmerich and andre braugher , are underused .  while in the film , which is not enough , the aforementioned actors steal every scene they are in .  frequency was a pleasant surprise for me and the audience i saw it with who cheered at the end .  even if you know what is going to happen or if you think the preview ruined the movie for you , like it almost did for me , check this movie out .  you may be surprised as well . 
neg@ pos neg if there's one thing i just can't stand , it's a film that oozes with sentimentality .  here's a note to all film makers : films are more effective when the emotions of the characters speak for themselves .  swelling , saddening music is not a good way to tell us that the people in the film are unhappy , and that the situation is hopeless .  alas , my giant is a film that uses manipulative sentimentality so frequently and with such high intensity that i forgot as i watched it that there are other ways of getting audience members choked up .  what reminded me was that i wasn't choked up , or even the slightest bit moved , for that matter .  my giant is a forced , contrived , and conspicuously un-cute ( i detest the word " cute " but i've chosen to use it because the makers clearly wanted to create a " cute " film here ) .  it takes a premise that might have been interesting ( i liked the preview ) , and bogs it down with endless plot turns and cliches , all of which are intended to get some kind of easy emotional rise from the audience .  maybe it will work for some people .  it didn't work for me .  billy crystal plays sam cayman , an agent who , at the beginning of the film , is in romania .  he's in romania because the kid actor he made famous is doing a film .  the screenplay has him in romania so he can get fired , get in a car accident , and get saved by an enormous individual who stands almost eight feet tall .  his name is max ( gheorghe muresan ) , and sam thinks he'd be a great movie star because of his size .  subplots are as follows : sam has a son and a wife ( kathleen quinlan ) , and he's never around for them , so they move to chicago .  max is in love with a woman named lilianna who moved away from romania twenty years before the film begins .  sam convinces max to go back to america with him so they can make lots of money , and so their various subplots can all be resolved .  sam is broke .  max is dying .  pass the kleenex .  my giant , as a comedy , is only moderately funny .  it has its moments , the best of which features steven seagal making fun of himself .  in one great scene , sam gets his son on the phone to talk to seagal ; of course , his son doesn't believe that he's actually speaking to seagal , and he goes off about how bad of an actor he is ( i would quote the line i like but it would probably lose its effect ) .  crystal is always entertaining , and he has a few good lines here ( some of which are subtle throwaways that many will miss entirely ) ; often , however , he's countered by a slew of jokes that aren't funny , and cause an involuntary rolling of the eyes .  muresan is kind of fun to watch , but he just can't act very well .  quinlan , on the other hand , is a great actress who needs to get a role that shows off her talents .  she was underused last year in both event horizon and breakdown , but at least in those films she had moments in which she could show us her stuff .  here , the best thing she gets to do is fake a romanian accent .  all of these disappointing ingredients create a film that , for much of its running time , is simply mediocre .  as my giant lumbers to its inevitable conclusion , however , director michael lehmann ( who did a great job directing the underrated hudson hawk ) and scriptwriter david seltzer pile on every cliche imaginable , each one intended specifically to pull at our heartstrings .  sam's multiple engagements with his family are all completely hackneyed ( how about a main character who has a healthy relationship with his family ? ) .  later , it turns out the entire story is supposed to be a great big metaphor signifying sam's reunion with his family .  and some people might think that what sam does for max towards the end is a valiant thing , but i had a few morality problems with it ( and i apologize for being vague ) .  it's icky .  it drips with gooey , wannabe human emotions .  my giant could have been a straightforward and funny family film .  more importantly , it could have been moving on a level far deeper than it is .  instead , it's a complicated , overlong , and under-engaging film that elicits too few laughs and strives for superficial tears .  and since it left me feeling completely unmoved , i stand by my position that sentimentality is evil and will ultimately destroy the world . 
pos@ pos neg plot : a peculiar french girl grows up lonely with her father and doesn't quite know what she wants out of life .  one day , she falls upon something , and believes that her ticket to happiness may be in helping others .  she starts with the people around her , but when she suddenly falls for her own guy , she can't act strongly enough because of her shy and dreamy nature .  critique : a clever , quirky , original french flick set in a picturesque paris , featuring an endearing lead with a giant imagination , much loneliness and a little bit of love for everyone .  this is a " feel-good " kind of movie , a fairy tale for grown-ups who are bummed out about life .  it doesn't pretend to be deep , it doesn't weigh itself down with long expositions or intricate studies of its characters , it's basically just a " cute movie " in the same vein as chocolat and pay it forward , with some amazing visuals and incredibly nice intentions ( and if chocolat was somehow able to nab an oscar nomination for best picture last year ( a sham on so many different levels ) , you might as well slap this film up for consideration also , since it's quite a bit better and much more original than the former ) .  one thing that this film isn't though , at least according to me , is the best film of the year ( it was bestowed the honor of " best " in at least 3 different film festivals so far this year ) .  it actually managed to stagnate a little bit about halfway through and it just went on for way too long ( it's a little over two hours but it felt even longer ) , with much of the second half of the movie devoted to many different characters , all of whom weren't as interesting as the lead , and a lot of indecisiveness from ms . amelie herself , which got frustrating .  thankfully , this film doesn't bog itself down with too much of that stuff , and actually goes out of its way to invent new ways to shoot scenes , to integrate moments of fantasy into its fabric and to transport the audience inside the imagination of this kind-hearted french girl .  on the whole , it's a lot of fun and it carries a beautiful message of love and support for your fellow man .  the lead , audrey tautou , is perfect for the role , and gives you enough moments of truth to develop her character into someone that you care about by the end of the film .  unfortunately , the rest of the cast isn't as well-developed , and even though most of them are pretty appealing , a couple could've been left out to save time and at least one was left stranded plot-wise , by the film's end ( what happened to the guy in the caf ? who was spying on his ex-girlfriend the whole movie ? ) .  now i haven't seen too many recent french films , i will admit , but if this is the kind of " scene " that they're developing over in " le pays du vin " , i wouldn't mind catching more of their flicks in the future ( crimson rivers was another french film that i saw earlier this year , which i really liked- ironically , that film was directed by mathieu kassovitz , who is the co-star in this film ) .  granted , the english subtitles got a little tough to keep up with at times ( i speak and understand french also , but some of the local colloquialisms went over my head ) , especially since the film's visuals were so intriguing that you just couldn't help but constantly gawk at them , but the general idea , the background music , the nifty french neighborhoods , the very creative way of enveloping the audience into the story-line from the start , were all very easy to appreciate , and i for one was especially glad to have seen this movie during these trying times in the world .  in fact , i'd recommend it to anyone looking for a jolly ol' time at the movie house , with a particular emphasis on folks with a lot of imagination , a little loneliness in their lives and many dreams in their hearts .  and this guy directed alien : resurrection ?  get outta here ! !  note : i especially loved the way that the script detailed and showed the loves/hates of everyone with exact mentions in the film .  it was very original , very well shot and very nostalgic , as many of us were able to relate to the behaviors described .  good stuff !  where's joblo coming from ?  chocolat ( 6/10 ) - crimson rivers ( 8/10 ) - ghost world ( 9/10 ) - like water for chocolate ( 8/10 ) - o brother , where art thou ( 7/10 ) - pay it forward ( 5/10 ) - rushmore ( 9/10 ) - woman on top ( 7/10 ) 
neg@ pos neg and now the high-flying hong kong style of filmmaking has made its way down to the classics , and it isn't pretty .  this time out the nod to asia goes by way of france in the excruciating bland and lukewarm production of the musketeer , a version of dumas's the three musketeers .  by bringing in popular asian actor/stunt coordinator xing xing xiong -- whose only prior american attempts at stunt choreography have been the laughable van damme vehicle double team and the dennis rodman cinematic joke simon sez -- our musketeers are thrown into the air to do their fighting .  the end result is a tepid and dull action/adventure rip-off that stinks of indiana jones and bad asian kung fu .  the story is so simple my grandmother could have adapted the screenplay .  d'artagnan ( justin chambers ) is the vengeful son of a slain musketeer .  he travels to paris to join the royal musketeers and find the man that killed his parents .  in paris , he meets the cunning cardinal richelieu ( stephen rea ) , who is trying to overthrow the king , and richelieu's man-in-black associate febre ( tim roth ) , the killer of his folks .  he finds the musketeers in paris disbanded and drunk , so he rounds up aramis ( nick moran ) , athos ( jan gregor kremp ) and porthos ( steven spiers ) to free the musketeer's wrongfully imprisoned leader treville from the king's prison .  d'artagnan and his new frisky love interest/chambermaid francesca ( mena suvari ) play footsy and coo at each other as the cardinal hunts down the musketeers until finally the queen ( catherine deneuve ) ends up being captured by the menancing febre , forcing the musketeers to regroup , with d'artagnan leading the charge , and save the day .  director peter hyams ( end of days ) obviously wanted to blend eastern and western filmmaking styles , but here it's a disaster .  one problem is that , in reality , most eastern films have taken their lead from western ones .  jet li's high risk is a rip-off of die hard -- not the other way around .  ironically , there is awfully little swordplay or action in the film at all -- maybe ten minutes of swashbuckling spread over five scenes .  most asian action films carry the bulk of their production with 20- to 30-minute action sequences , because they know the scenes have to carry the picture .  the musketeer instead weighs itself down with a predictable and monotonous screenplay by gene quintano ( sudden death ) , horrible acting by stephen rea and tim roth , and the prosaic attempt of justin chambers ( the wedding planner ) to deliver his mousy self as a leader .  chambers' d'artangnan isn't a musketeer -- he's a mouseketeer !  and hyam's use of candles and torches to light the grime and filth of 17th century paris are well-noted , but that's the only standout in an overall flat production . 
pos@ pos neg one of the funniest carry on movies and the third with a medical setting .  the main story is about dr . james nookey ( jim dale ) who is disliked by his superiors , frederick carver , head of the hospital ( kenneth williams ) , and dr . ernest stoppidge ( charles hawtrey ) who seems to dislike everyone .  they attempt to cause him as much trouble in the hospital as possible and all the blame is laid on nookey .  carver learns of a possible job opportunity from wealthy ellen moore ( joan sims ) on a distant tropical island and gets nookey trannsferred there .  when nookey arrives at this island , he meets gladstone screwer ( sid james ) who has lived on the island just about all his life .  screwer is in possession of a wonderful slimming drug made from natural ingredients .  dr . nookey returns with the drug to england and sets up a new slimming business with ellen moore's financial backing .  however , nookey and moore face opposition from screwer who goes to england to cash in on the drug , and carver and stoppidge who want to know the ingredients to create a rival drug .  the performances are all very commendable .  sid james has a slightly ambiguous character to play this time and he excels in his role .  kenneth williams , as usual , plays the unpopular and cunning head of the hospital .  joan sims is entertaining as the wealthy benefactor and jim dale should really head the cast with his excellent portrayal of bumbling nookey .  charles hawtrey plays an 'out-of-character' role as dr . stoppidge , the nasty and evil practitioner who wants to knock nookey off his perch .  some critics have said that this combination of hawtrey and stoppidge does not work well , but i think that it at least gives hawtrey a new part to play instead of the usual dimwit characters .  as a matter of fact , hawtrey is suitably cunning in the part .  other regulars in the movie include hattie jacques as the matron yet again ( but this part is probably her most boring 'matron' ) and barbara windsor as nookey's love interest and unofficial 'women's lib' campaigner , goldie locks .  both jacques and windsor play their parts well .  patsy rowlands appears briefly as miss fosdick , and there are very small cameos from wilfrid brambell ( from 'steptoe and son' fame ) and peter butterworth .  the jokes are mostly very funny , the story is quite appealing , and the regulars seem interested in what they're doing .  although it is another medical carry on movie and some of the jokes are borrowed from previous movies , it still comes out on top ( it is the best medical carry on ) because of the above factors .  a must-see carry on movie . 
neg@ pos neg the new austin powers film continues a movie tradition begun in the eighties .  produce something , anything , that will get the high school and junior high kids in the theater because they buy more soda and popcorn than senior citizens .  the usual hallmarks of this filmmaking tradition are all here .  gross humor , sex jokes , silly sight gags , more sex jokes .  and the film is a strong contender in the current race to be cruder , grosser and more outrageous than that last film .  what the film is not , however , is funny .  the plot centers around the return of dr . evil , who goes back in time to steal austin powers' mojo ( a liquid with red stuff in it extracted from austin's pelvis ) which gives austin his sexual prowess and the charisma to defeat his enemies .  austin must go after him , and returns to the swinging sixties where free love and sexy secret agents had their heyday .  i almost avoided this film because i did not like the original .  but the films premise sounded like an excellent comic vehicle and the film received many good reviews .  i wish i had stuck to my first impression .  myers is trying to be the jerry lewis of this generation .  and he has the talent to do it , at least as an actor .  but the material he is working with here , much of it his own , falls short of anything resembling comic genius .  this movie tries to carry the day with sight gags about drinking distilled feces , a five-hundred-pound fat man's butt crack , and a barrage of sex jokes aimed at the level of the average 15 year old .  after some of these scenes , one has to wonder how gross the next generation of films will have to go to get an audiences attention .  the direction also helps the film achieve a new low point in cinematic humor .  for the most part , i felt as if i was watching a saturday morning chalderns live action tv show .  there is no sense of comic timing or subtlety .  the director just throws the material at us , giving us nothing except the hope that anyone with a camera could be a film director .  i am sure the film will have appeal to many of the under 22 crowd , at least the one's who have yet to discover literacy .  certainly the movie is directed towards the generation that prefers everything described as 'in your face , kick you in the teeth , take no prisoners , ( action-verb +blah blah blah ) . '  if you see the film and you find you're not laughing , there is nothing wrong with you .  it just means you grew up since seventh grade . 
pos@ pos neg magnolia left me relling from the theatre , staggering from the relentless assault of an adventurous director reveling in his craft .  at nearly three and a half hours , magnolia will strike some as a brute of a film .  it not only demands your attention , but challenges you to grasp the significance of seemingly unrelated storylines and hidden intentions .  it is delirious , depressing , heady , pretentious , surreal filmmaking .  it's also a movie that will polarize its viewers .  director paul thomas anderson takes a talented cast , wraps them in a net of interrelated stories and sets them spinning in a symphony of despair whose song doesn't let up until an oddly exhilerating , biblically influenced pseudo-climax .  the character's make up a modern day gomorrah in the soulless way in which they live their lives .  there is frank mackey ( tom cruise ) , a slithery snake charmer of men whose " search and destroy " seminars teach how to mentally rape a woman to get into her pants .  there is earl partridge ( jason robards ) , a dying media tycoon yearning to make amends for a lfe of callousness by finding his estranged son .  there is game show host jimmy gator ( phillip baker hall ) , a self absorbed tv icon who is hiding more than a few secrets from his public .  and there is police officer jim kurring ( john c . reilly ) , who cloaks himself in the codification of organized religion and the legal system , perhaps masking a man who needs rules to fuel his decision making process .  given equal weight are stories involving a coke-addled emotional cripple ( melora walters ) , a former tv quiz show champion ( william h . macy ) .  a materialistic , adulterous wife ( julianne moore ) , a child ( jeremy blackman ) victimized by a mentally abusive parent , and a caring , empathetic nurse ( philip seymour hoffman ) .  hovering over all these characters is a cloud of death , lies and despair .  it is not a pleasant movie .  there is not one bad note in the acting .  it is affecting and layered and wonderful .  there is a moment where tom cruise wordlessly implodes that rivals work he has done in whole films .  then he tops himself with a mesmerizing deathbed scene .  walters plays her character with red-eyed rawness and a fierce self-destructiveness that is anxiety inducing .  robards convincingly portrays a fading whisper of a man , who still hears a lion's roar when he speaks .  director anderson has apparently given the actors lattitude to emote .  the problem is that he stays on them too long .  julianne moore's character , linda , quickly escalates to a frenzied pitch of guilt , tears , screaming and remorse and never backs off from it .  after a few hours , it turns from interesting to chinese water torture .  quite a few scenes , such as the game show , go on just a bit too long and will be off-putting for those used to a pat 90 minute film where the main theme is reiterated several times just in case you missed it the first go around .  and just what is the theme ?  alienation ?  hopelessness ?  anderson challenges you to draw your own conclusions and he doesn't make it easy .  the film starts by showing three , strange and seemingly unrelated events .  it's a harbinger of the synchronicity to come .  at times , different stories reach reach key moments at the same time .  other times , stories seem to veer off into uncharted territory , regardless of what else is happening .  anderson is audacious enough to even have a group sing in the middle of the film !  what's surprising is that it mostly works .  if you have doubts about anderson's intentions , i'll ask you to pay attention to the final frame .  despite all the sturm und drang , magnolia ultimately speaks to man's capacity for hope and attempts at redemption .  despite magnolia's needlessly long running time and its propensity for uneven editing as anderson plays the auteur , showing off fro the masses , i have to admire his guts .  this is truly adventurous filmmaking that spits in the face of conventional storytelling .  my rating : a bulleye .   ( stars )  a side note : helping anchor the film is a perfectly matched soundtrack featuring aimee mann .  her lyrics often add depth to a scene thematically while the actual music is both morose and beautiful .  when she sings " save me " at the end , it enhances the yearning felt by the characters , just as " wise up " mirrors the anguish felt by all as they contemplate their lives . 
neg@ pos neg synopsis : blond criminal psychologist sarah chooses to copulate with greasy tony the mysterious puerto rican rather than bearded cliff the wisecracking neighbor upstairs .  in the meantime , someone sends sarah rotting flowers , puts her name in the newspaper's obituary column , and kills her cat .  comments : never talk to strangers , a colossal waste of time , moves slower than molasses in winter to arrive at a conclusion which should be obvious to the audience 20 minutes into the film .  one wouldn't think that two genuine movie stars , antonio banderas ( evita ) and rebecca de mornay ( hand that rocks the cradle ) , and the acerbic comic genius dennis miller ( " saturday night live " ) would be involved in such a celluloid backfire as this turkey .  not only are they in it , however , but de mornay executive produced it .  what was she thinking ?  never talk to strangers centers upon sarah , a psychologist examining the ill-tempered max , a murderer soon to stand trial .  she receives a sudden visit from her father which elicits flashbacks of some tragedy in her early childhood .  two men woo her ; tony the " security consultant " wins her over ( so they have passionate sex replete with cheesy saxophone music ) .  a lot of psychobabble is thrown around about multiple personality disorder , but the movie asks its audience not to derive the obvious conclusion between mpd and sarah , and instead offers several male characters as red herrings .  86 minutes , the running time of this cinematic mess , thus , seem like 86 hours .  a good chunk of never talk to strangers is spent upon sarah and tony .  why would the career-minded , professional sarah feel attracted to the walking steroid with a black hat called tony ?  that's one of the film's mysteries which are never answered .  regardless of motive , de mornay and banderas strip down and have sex several times in what passes for eroticism .  they also manage to go out before copulating occasionally -- in one of the stupidest scenes of the film , tony takes sarah to a carnival that's * right outside * his dingy apartment ( that way , they can hurry back and have sex quickly ) .  also , apparently , the weather changes quickly in their locale : they're at this outdoor carnival one day before having sex ; the next day , they're out playing in the snow before having sex .  the filmmakers attempt to produce a suspenseful plot interspersed with tony and sarah's " character development . "  someone is out to get poor sarah ( though most of the audience should have figured out who before any of this starts ) .  rotting flowers , a writeup in the obituary , and a beaten neighbor are just a few of the bad things which happen to her .  suspense cliche number one also occurs : whenever someone is stalked in thrillers , by any means , if the stalked has a pet , that pet will die .  oftentimes , to even further the cliche , the murdered pet is a cat ( suspense filmmakers , for some reason , just don't like cats ) .  sarah , in never talk to strangers , receives a package and , lo and behold , discovers her mutilated cat within .  suspense at its very derivative !  as stated before , never talk to strangers is a poor excuse for a film whose sole purpose seems to be exploiting banderas and de mornay's bodies as often as possible .  comedian dennis miller is completely wasted here ( he's not given lines that are suitable for his persona ) and doesn't even appear all that much .  maybe , in a way , he's lucky for that .  early on in the movie , sarah tells tony , after meeting him in a supermarket , that she had been advised to never talk to strangers .  allow me to advise that you never watch this stinker .

"  i've always subscribed to the philosophy that any idea ( no matter how many times it's been used before ) can provide for a good story and " donnie brasco " clinches this idea .  it's not unlike most of the great films of the genre , yet it never apes another's style as it has a good layer of authenticity , even if its core is a tad stale .  the film starts off in typical fashion by defining its atmosphere of new york city in the late 1970s and the mobsters who inhibit it .  we meet lefty ( pacino ) , an aging wiseguy who can still walk the walk and talk the talk .  he and his associates go through the generic motions you expect to see in crime films like this .  somehow he comes across donnie brasco ( depp ) , a younger guy with a lot of spunk who isn't afraid of lefty and his rep , and even manages to befriend him after lefty was ready to kill him .  it's clear donnie is new to the life and lefty recognizes this immediately , telling him all the tricks of the trade .  i have never seen this technique of actually revealing the mafioso idiosyncrasies done before and for this the film deserves credit .  however , we soon realize donnie is actually joe pistone , an fbi agent working undercover - a character who symbolizes the viewer as he will soon be purged into the lifestyle and treated as a newcomer .  the first act works as a guided to ot of rhetoric about wiseguy honor , a brief history of the mob , definitions of their slang , and where their money comes from and who it goes to .  the screenplay is rather sketchy on the details surrounding these elements , however , the fact they are mentioned at all is quite original .  most gangster movies seem to be made with the notion the viewer already knows how the mob works ( probably from watching other gangster movies ) , and although this attitude comes across , the film tries to fill in all the holes where and when it can and the effort is appreciable .  thankfully the film doesn't become too caught up in the tedious details of organized crime , and instead opts for character development .  much of the story is told simply through the interaction between lefty and donnie .  pacino is outstanding here as the pathetic hood who speaks of his job in the same manner any blue collar worker would .  he's old and exhausted but seems to enjoy what he does , just as anyone loyal to the same employer for over 30 years might be .  we learn of his accomplishments , which are quite impressive within their context , and when he complains about not being made top boss , it's easy to sympathize with him .  newell constantly plays up this aspect , making it a major theme which works well in the long run .  as donnie is constantly impressing and even one-upping lefty , it's hard to tell which emotion is more powerful : the fact donnie is getting closer to nailing the mob ; or the fact lefty has once again been over shadowed .  most of the film tells the story of donnie's life in mafia , which creates for many sub-plots and individual conflicts , but doesn't always seem to come together as a whole .  the storytelling is genuinely interesting throughout , even when the motions the characters go through seem familiar .  the resonance to donnie's actual assignment varies , he often reports back to the feds with detail of his progress , but it doesn't always seem to have much meaning .  back home , his wife maggie ( heche ) is ready to divorce him because he's never a and the family is suffering .  since this is based on a true story i wouldn't doubt this would happen , although the way it is handled often borders on the melodramatic .  my only major complaint is the film seems to have no final act , or at least any real sense of closure .  a climax of sorts does occur , but there's little feeling of a payoff .  we get a happy ending , which is good , but perhaps a sad ending would have been more powerful .  aside from a few minor , general flaws , " donnie brasco " manages to be a solid piece of storytelling and character development .  it may be routine , but it's good , and that's respectful . 
neg@ pos neg confucius once said , " governing a nation is like cooking a small fish -- don't overdo it . "  his maxim might be easily applied to writing a comedy script , for quantity over quality is one of the worst mistakes an amateur scribe can make .  granted , mike judge , writer-director of the workplace satire office space isn't exactly an amateur ( his most infamous work , the mtv series " beavis and butt-head " was pure gold for its network ) .  but unfailingly , judge manages to make some rather inexcusable mistakes in office space by spreading an iffy plot over too much ground .  the iffiness in judge's plot -- a group of coworkers plan the downfall of their despicable boss -- is not in its appeal .  in fact , based on the popularity of scott adams' cartoon " dilbert , " which will soon have its own television series , a satirical view of the american workplace is a hot item in hollywood .  unfortunately the concept lends itself to skit-length sequences which would be more at home on the set of " saturday night live " rather than a full-length feature .  the most convincing evidence of this are the trailers for office space , which feature almost all of the movie's top content ; this leaves the actual picture appearing very deflated .  other evidence of office space's failure to work are its lack of good jokes .  the comedy is marginally funny at best , but not enough to get a packed house of theater-goers to laugh out loud .  the material in the movie is on-key for an older demographic than judge is used to targeting , and this could partially explain his work here .  however , the movie is loaded with too many misfires -- including the token plot -- to allow for any excuse .  the plot centers around three or four cubicled engineers , headed up by peter gibbons ( ron livingston ) , at a company named initech .  after the movie elaborately establishes the miserable working conditions at initech , the movie introduces us to two consultants ( john c . mcginley and paul willson ) which are in charge of " downsizing " the company's payroll .  when peter and his gang learns of this , as well as the reason behind it -- so their smooth talking boss bill lumbergh ( gary cole ) 's stock will go up -- they set about creating a plan to see his downfall .  the circumstances that follow were obviously intended to be hilarious but they come out as anything but .  a sympathetic cast and a muddled jennifer aniston-as-love-interest subplot are all that keep this one together , but it's definitely missable in lieu of something more intelligent . 
pos@ pos neg the 1998 summer movie season is still in its infancy .  but after diasappointing films such as " godzilla " and " fear and loathing in las vegas " , it would be nice to see a really good film .  but i doubt you could have expected this .  the truman show is one of the most unique films i have ever seen , and it deserves a spot on the " decade's best " list .  there is no way to isolate any single component of this picture and proclaim , " yes , that's what makes this film great . "  the blend of peter weir's masterful ( and in many ways brilliant ) direction , peter biziou's stunning photography and jim carrey's performance is what makes this film work so fantastically .  there is something strangely beautiful about every shot in the truman show .  it may be the use of color or the placement of characters in the frame , but everything about this film looks intentional and perfect .  carrey has made a very wise choice .  by playing mild-mannered truman burbank , he allows himself enough room to be comical , and therefore not alienating his true fans , while still showing a vulnerable and human side .  that is a side which has been missing from nearly every major character he has played in his numerous commercial successes .  truman burbank was born to an audience of millions .  he was chosen before birth to be the focus of a 24 hour television show .  everything in his environment is controlled by a team of technicians , led by the show's director , christof ( played by ed harris ) .  everyone in truman's life is an actor or an extra .  they are all being watched by millions of people around the globe , people who can tune in at any time of the day to see what is happening in truman's life .  but he is the only person that is not aware of it .  the classification of the truman show may be tricky .  the audience reacted to many of truman's revelations with laughter .  i did not laugh much during the film because i was so emotionally wrapped up with the character .  the things that made the audience laugh gave me glassy eyes , because what was happening to him , indeed what had been done to him his whole life was wrong .  so is this going to end up labeled as a comedy ?  a drama ?  it really depends on the audience .  but to me , the truman show was a touching , sad tale about the extents to which a corporation will go to exploit human life for the entertainment of others .  but above all else , the truman show was a stunningly beautiful picture with humor , heart and scary realism .  oscar predictions in june are pointless , but if the truman show had been released on schedule in late fall or winter of 1997 , as originally planned , james cameron would be oscar-less . 
neg@ pos neg poster boy for co-dependency needs patching  patch adams a film review by michael redman copyright 1999 by michael redman  mediocrity is a pox on civilization .  in our heavily consumer oriented society , there is an enormous demand to churn out " stuff . "  what would happen to our economy if we didn't feel the need to have more things ?  to make us buy more , businesses need to produce a ton of product .  the sheer volume of items necessitates that most of them are of dubious quality .  the film industry is like any other .  in order for studios to survive , they have to make money .  the prevailing attitude is that more films equal more profit .  some movies obviously exist only to put wares on the screen and to do that , less talented people are used .  there aren't enough great directors and actors to create the number of films necessary .  for some reason , it's never crossed anyone's mind that the real equation is quality films = more profit .  often , mediocre films are more of a pain for the audience than the horrendous ones .  at you can have a good time making fun of bad movies .  i'm not suggesting that " patch adams " was tossed out just to rake in the bucks .  my guess is that someone was asleep at the wheel .  it features an accomplished actor and a potentially engrossing story , but it's as dull as could be .  hunter " patch " adams' ( robin williams ) desire to become a doctor has an unusual genesis .  checking himself into a mental institute after a suicide attempt , he discovers that he can help the other patients by clowning around .  patch could be a poster boy for co-dependency .  he explains that he likes devoting himself to others because then he doesn't focus on his own problems .  he decides that he wants to be a physician , leaves the place and a couple of years later enrolls in the medical college of virginia .  as a med student , patch's antics at the school's hospital catch the attention of his soon to be arch-enemy , straight-laced dean walcott ( bob gunton ) .  the dean is so opposed to the goofiness that he wants patch kicked out of school although he's one of the top students .  he writes in patch's academic file that he shows " excessive happiness . "  i walked into the film knowing little about its history and wondered about its odd mechanical pacing .  there also seemed to be no reason that it is set in the early seventies .  then it struck me .  it must be based on a true story .  the movie is an adaptation of a book by hunter adams who founded the gesundheit institute , a free clinic .  robin williams is an amazing actor .  while he is adept at dramatic roles , his forte is over-the-top free spirits .  that's what makes his failure here so remarkable .  patch is exactly the character he should be best at , yet even the scene where he and another mental patient are battling fierce imaginary squirrels falls flat .  something holds him back .  most of the rest of the cast is two-dimensional .  for a film that champions seeing patients as human beings , it's curious that the ones here are cardboard characters .  peter coyote as a man dying of cancer is refreshing because he seems like a real person .  unfortunately he's in the film for only about two minutes .  the audience is blatantly lead by a ring in its nose from scene to scene .  we're not left to our own emotional decisions : we're hit over the head with them .  shaved-headed children with cancer , an elderly woman whom patch makes laugh , a beautiful woman who can't love because of her abusive history .  when a group of students fix up an old house to use as a clinic in the andy hardy " hey , let's put on a play !  we can use the barn and my mom can make the curtains ! "  mode , they laugh and roll around while painting each other .  there might as well be giant signs flashing : " feel good now ! "   " feel bad now ! "   " patch " is a good title for the film .  it is a patchwork of every manipulative scene you can think of .  the full-of-life student fights stodgy establishment types .  there's a touching death .  then there's another .  the film doesn't trust us to get it the first time .  the dean tries to kick patch out and later he tries again .  worst of all is the final courtroom bit .  scary-looking old men sit in judgment of a man who only wants to help people .  the room is packed with patch's supporters .  williams makes a supposedly impassioned speech about the humanity of all .  it has as much emotion as his earlier statement " humans are the only animal that kills members of its own species " contains truth .  most of the blame must be placed with the director tom shadyac and screenwriter steve oedekerk .  shadyac also directed the first " ace ventura " movie .  oedekerk directed the second one .  need i say more ?  the real adams is to be admired for his devotion to treating patients as people rather than diseases .  the film has a number of worthy messages about the state of the modern medical business with hmos and managed care .  the " doctors are not gods " theme will resonate with a number of people , but it's so poorly produced that no one will care . 
pos@ pos neg the heist of a flawless , 84 carat diamond , fixed bare knuckle fights , irish gypsies and a dog are just some of the goings on in director guy ritchies's sophomore feature , " snatch . "   " lock , stock and two smoking barrels " intro'd helmer/scripter ritchie with a hyper-kinetic , in your face underworld comedy that grabbed the viewer's attention from beginning to end .  his protagonists were innocents set adrift in a see of sharks to swim or be eaten alive .  with " snatch , " the director doesn't remake his first work , but he does delve more deeply into the criminal underbelly of london , mining a rich collection of characters in the process .  >from the very beginning , " snatch " tosses you into the action with the theft of the fabulous diamond , the desire of new york gangster avi ( dennis farina ) .  en route from antwerp , diamond thief and courier frankie four fingers ( benicio del toro ) stops in london to make a separate deal with avi's partner and cousin , doug " the head " ( mike reid ) .  frankie's addiction to gambling tempts him into making a bet on an illegal boxing match for boris " the blade " ( rade sherbedgia ) , a ruthless russian mobster .  the bet turns out to be a setup for a robbery by a trio of bumbling incompetents - vinnie ( robbie gee ) , sol ( lennie james ) and portly tyrone ( ade ) - that goes miserably awry .  meanwhile , a couple of young toughs , turkish ( jason stratham ) and tommy ( stephen graham ) , are trying to break in to the boxing game with the help of local villain brick top ( alan ford ) , who also owns a pig farm .  when their first fighter is put out of action , with one punch , by a wild irish gypsy named mickey o'neil , they figure to put the loose canon in as the contender in a fixed fight .  mickey proves less than reliable and goes against turkish and tommy's deal .  brick top , impressed by mickey's performance , decides to gives them another chance - after calmly explaining that it takes 16 pigs about eight minutes to completely devour a corpse .  when avi doesn't get his precious rock , he jumps on a plane for london and hires a local legend , " bullet tooth " tony ( vinnie jones ) , to find frankie and the diamond .  things spiral out of control as all these forces head on a collision course of double-cross and double-deals - and a dog that ate a squeaky toy .  guy ritchie ( mr . madonna to some ) is an extraordinarily talented auteur who has a wonderful knack for pulling together his unique collection of cast and crew and feeding them funny and gritty dialog that spews out of the characters' mouths like machine gun fire .  the helmer marshals his large ensemble actors in a frantically paced caper comedy that makes you laugh and feel queasy at the same time , the above description by brick top being just one example .  the assemblage of actors and non-actors in rough-and-tumble settings gives " snatch " an earthy feel in its depiction of london's criminal underworld .  the cast of characters is too large to credit here , but two of the performances - first among equals , you might say - are worth noting .  alan ford is brilliant as the ruthless , evil brick top .  when he refuses sugar in his tea because " i'm sweet enough , " it makes you shiver , even as you laugh .  his is one of the best gangster characters i've seen in years .  the other outstanding perf is given by none other than brad pitt , the name actor the movie's popularity may hang upon , at least initially .  pitt , as mickey o'neil , is hard drinking , hard fighting , highly unreliable and nearly incomprehensible with a unique irish brogue and dialect of the pikers , the irish travelers of europe .  this gypsy brigand would steal the fillings from your teeth , especially if it would benefit his beloved mum ( sorcha cusack ) .  when brick top threaten the safety of mickey's family , he makes an enemy that cannot be stopped .  pitt puts a credible spin on his character and does some incredible physical stuff , too , as a bare-knuckle boxer .  the production team behind the camera includes ritchie alumni , producer matthew vaughn and lenser tim maurice-jones , and other talented technical artist that bring the hyperactive imagination of the author to visual life .  there is a patent feel to the look of " snatch " and " lock , stock and two smoking barrels " that reeks of " signature " for ritchie , but i'm not sure how this will translate in his future works .  there is so much talent in the filmmaker that i would like to see him branch out in other directions .  nonetheless , " snatch " is terrific sophomore effort , a darn good action comedy and a hoot to boot .  i give it a b+ . 
neg@ pos neg the above is dialogue from this film , taken almost completely in context , and not jazzed up a bit to make it more inept than it is .  it is spoken between two of the protagonists somewhere in the film , and basically serves as a perfect example of what this film is about , especially if you realize that this exchange is meant to be taken seriously .  mr . gregg " i'm-having-a-mid-life-crisis " araki , the writer and director of this film , wants to show how important teenagers are , and wants to show how they feel in such a horrible , horrible world .  and how does he show it ?  by really cheap surrealism , and moronic exchanges like this .  oh , and it gets better .  a similar bit of dialogue is said in the middle of , oh i dunno , the fiftieth sex scene in this film ( i'm not counting the several masturbation scenes ) .  in it , one of the protagonists is humping away on top of another , and he says to her something along the lines of " do you ever wonder what life is all about ? "  sorry , man : foreplay takes place before the act of coitus .  of course , what do you expect : the film was written and directed by a guy who can't even spell his first name right ( yes , i know it's a cheap joke , but it had to be done ) .   " the doom generation " is advertised as a road trip movie about people who go around killing others who attack them , and also as another " teen angst " film ( one of the slogans is " teen is a four-letter word " - hardy har har ) .  it's a film about two angsty teens - amy blue ( rose macgowan , who would later play the buxom tatum in " scream " ) and jordon white ( james duval , who would go on to play randy quaid's son in " independence day " ) - who pick up an angsty homicidal maniac , xavier red ( jonathan schaech , who would go on to play the angsty lead guitarist in " that thing you do ! "  - and by the way , do you get the symbolism ?  red , white , and blue ?  huh ?  huh ? ) , and go on a road trip where three things happen , in no order : 1 ) they have sex ; 2 ) they run into weird people ; 3 ) they kill them .  the film is basically a remix of a bunch of other far superior films .  gregg araki obviously has seen such films as " easy rider , " " natural born killers , " and " kalifornia , " and tries to borrow elements from all these films and make something which is like a pop culture reference guide .  but what he forgets is these films either represented something that this film does not , or that they dug deep into their subjects and brought something out of them to make them deeper .   " the doom generation " doesn't want to do this ; it just wants to show everything in a surreal manner for the sole reason that araki does not want to deal with them on any kind of real level .  he wants to show everything in a weird manner , and forgets what the scenes are supposed to be about .  here's one scene , an earlier scene in the film : amy and jordan go into a quick-e mart type place to get food and other stuff .  amy is smoking , and the clerk , an asian man mind you ( i love how racist this film is , i really do ) , tells her to put it out .  she tells him to fuck off or something to that note .  he points a shotgun at her , and she puts it out reluctantly .  jordan makes two hot dogs , and takes them to the counter .  the cash register rings up " 6 . 66 "   ( oh , and this symbolism doesn't stop here ) .  jordan checks for his wallet but it's really in the car .  he asks amy for it , but she left her wallet in the car as well .  the clerk brings out his shotgun again and asks for the money .  they say they don't have it .  he gets ready to kill them , but then xavier , who they ditched in the middle of nowhere a scene before , pops out of nowhere , fights with the clerk , and ends with him blowing the clerk's head clean off ( clean wound , mind you ) .  the head is shown flying through the air , and lands in a fryer , where it begins to scream .  i don't really object to this kind of sick violence , but this scene is in the film for one reason and one reason only : to gross you out .  araki thinks that if he takes everything to the extreme , he'll make some kind of art .  wrong .  it takes a kind of resistance to make gore art .  when george romero made " dawn of the dead , " a very gory flick even for today , he had control over everything and still was able to make everything sick .  same goes for peter jackson's disgustingly gory " dead alive , " which features a 30 minute long fest of blood , guts , dismemberments , flesh chewing , and other assorted stuff , all ending with a guy with a lawn mower strapped to his body , taking out all sorts of zombies .  it was sick , but it was also satirical , and controled .  a scene like this has no purpose in the film , and it sticks out from everything else that happens .  here's a couple other scenes : jordan and amy have sex in a bath tub and xavier watches , masturbates , and then licks the semen from his hand ; xavier and amy have sex and jordan watches from the window , masturbates , and falls backwards ; a man attacks the trio , and is stabbed in the crotch by a giant sword ( put there just so this could happen ) ; a fast food employee stalks the trio , and his arm is shot off by xavier ; and various other annoyances .  also , look for about a million camoes from a wide assortment of people , who probably didn't really know what they were getting into when they signed up to do it ( just like peter o'toole , helen mirren , malcolm macdowell , and john gielgud probably didn't when they signed to be in " caligula " ) .  people such as indie actors parker posey and nicky katt , alternative rock stars skinny puppy and perry farrel , hollywood madam heidi fleiss , christopher " peter brady " mcknight , amanda bearse , and margaret cho all grace the screen for a matter of seconds , then disappear so that we can return to the annoying main plot line .  why are they here ?  so that we can all point to them and say " hey , look it's ( fill in the blank ) !  wow ! "  gimme a break .  the film's meaning is pretty easy to detect : that , you know , teens are so precious , and the world is such a horrible place , that when the two entities collide , there's a giant explosion of horrific violence .  otherwise defined as " teen angst , " or the belief that being a teenager is a horrible thing and that the world is too bad for you .  look , i'm 19 years old .  i went through a very brief teen angst thing which curiously lasted about as long as my taste in nirvana did .  i've since moved on to " i don't really know what to do with my life " phase , but the teen angst phase is something which is so annoyingly sophomoric and ignorant that any film that thinks they're dealing with it on any kind of serious level is just beating the wrong horse .  part of being a teen is experimenting , and testing the waters .  it's not whining about how awful parents are , and purposely feeling dispondent .  this is what the characters in this film do , and the film wants to show how they're these great people who are being punished by the world because they're teenagers , and how they try to defend themselves but can't totally overcome them .  it's not their fault they kill people ; it's the world's !  what they really need is a reality check .  the world is a bad place , and teenagers can be easily harmed because they are experimenting .  but part of it is taking everything that happens to you and learning from it .  the film thinks that teenagers are basically doomed , and there's nothing they can do about it .  hence the title .  not only does it have bad fallacy , but it can't even express this in an intelligent and coherent manner .  everything's overly surreal , and all we get are scenes of graphic violence and graphic sex .  how does xavier licking semen off his hand express teen angst ?  how does a talking decapitated head show that teens are dispondent because the world makes them this way ?  and why does the film constantly go back to the teen angst issue of the film ?  if araki had any kind of competence in writing or direction , he'd show them for what they really are .  and if he didn't want the satirical approach , he'd show the real problems with the world .  and if you still don't think that " the doom generation " is incompetent on every single possible level it could be , take the acting .  rose macgowan is horrible .  yes , she proved herself talented in " scream , " but she's so bad in " the doom generation " that if i had not seen her in " scream , " i would have christened her one of the worst actresses working in films today .  her entire performance is one-note ( bitchy ) , and the one scene where she cries over a dead animal is so forced that it's laughable .  equally bad is jonathan schaech , who wants to be the slacker serial killer : someone who doesn't have any remorse because emotions cause some kind of strain .  his performance is annoying as hell , and granted , he was better in " that thing you do ! "  and then there's james duval .  let's just say he makes keanu reeves look like brando .  he has the same kind of slacker stuttering , only much much much worse , and every line he says is so bad that i have now deemed him " least talented actor in the world . "  i have seen lots of bad actors , but james duval has got to be the worst .  or at least somewhere up there .  here's another example of a bad scene , if you're still not convinced : the film opens up in a club where they're playing nine inch nail's most banal song , " heresy " ( example of the lines : " god is dead/and no one cares/if there is a hell/i'll see you there " ) , and as the song plays , and red strobe lights show the patrons dancing , the film pans over to amy , just standing there , looking dispondent .  the film closes in on her , she looks right at the camera and says " fuck . "  no explanation of this should be necessary .  and finally , a note to gregg : grow up .  really .  move out of your parent's basement , read something other than salinger , and get a day job .  and don't quit it . 
pos@ pos neg synopsis : committed to an asylum , the marquis de sade ( rush ) continues to publish pornographic literature , aided by young maid madeleine ( winslet ) .  abbe coulmier ( phoenix ) , who runs the hospital , disapproves of the stories , but humours him in the hope of achieving a cure .  de sade's craft and life are threatened when the emperor dispatches dr royer-collard ( michael caine ) to stop the marquis' work , permanently .  review : " quills " is an exploration of the marquis de sade : his madness , his cruelty and his perversion , his obsession with sex in any form , no matter how obscene .  but " quills " also details the marquis' determination : to write in spite of the obstacles put in his path , and to propagate his words to the masses .  the extent to which de sade is willing to go to practise his trade is amongst the movie's most intriguing elements , as when de sade scribes a story in his own blood , or narrates a tale via of a chain of fellow inmates , cell to cell .  to provide a contrast with the marquis , wright involves him with two very different characters .  one is the abbe , a handsome , charming and kindly man whose desires are stymied by his oath to god .  the abbe lusts for madeleine , but it is the wizened marquis who is able to have her .  and then there is royer-collard , a hypocrite who in truth is as sadistic as any of the marquis' motley creations .  rush is splendid as de sade , utterly inhabiting the character .  kaufman's direction is fine , and he is able to bring a sense of bizarre humour to the grim proceedings .  the plot itself is rather mundane and plays out unsurprisingly , but this is virtually unimportant .  for two hours , " quills " acquaints us with the marquis de sade -- and , more frightening still , allows us brief insight into his scatological soul .

" godzilla " opens with stock footage of the bikini atoll nuclear tests interspersed with footage of iguanas playfully swimming and nuzzling their eggs .  we are then introduced to the crew of a japanese fish canning ship ( a questionable enterprise considering that tuna processing is supposed to be supervised to eliminate the netting of dolphins ) .  well , the ship is attacked and sunk by an unseen creature .  later , a group of frenchmen led by philippe roache ( jean reno ) interview the sole survivor .  in a state of shock , the only thing the man can utter is the word " gojira " ( the japanese name of the famed beast ) .  we are then introduced to dr . nick tatopoulos ( matthew broderick , with a moniker obviously taken from the effects designer of the film ) .  he is currently studying the effects that the chernobyl disaster has had on the local earthworm population .  he is immediately drafted by the u . s . military and taken to panama where he is shown the huge footprints of a creature .  in a short amount of time , another fishing boat ( loaded with canned tuna from the u . s . and korea for some reason ) is found grounded in jamaica .  well , it seems that whatever is eating these ships is headed for new york .  when the beast finally appears , he tears up one building , stomps a couple of trucks and makes life hell for the incumbent mayor ebert ( thumbs up for new york ) .  the military , with dr . tatopoulos's help , have two tons of fresh fish dumped in the middle of new york to lure the beast out of its hiding place in the new york subway system .  it finally comes crashing through the city streets and has a cute face to face with dr . tatopoulos who snaps the beast's picture .  the monster eats the fish , the military starts shooting , and the chase is on , with the army causing 90% of the ensuing damage .  working from a hunch as to why godzilla has decided to come to the big apple , dr . totopoulos buys a few home pregnancy kits from a local drugstore that has chosen to remain open ( even though new york has been evacuated ) .  well the test proves that the monster is a hermaphrodite and is pregnant .  needless to say , no one believes the good doctor about his discovery , so he must join up with the renegade french secret service agents and find the monster's nesting site and destroy the eggs before the mayor starts letting the populous back into the city ( even though the monster isn't dead yet ) .  i sincerely hope that i've completely spoiled any interest anyone might have of seeing this film .  i gave away the relevant plot so that i could spare those of you courageous ( or foolish ) enough to drop down an hour's wage on this tripe .  everything about " godzilla " reeks almost as bad as the piles of rotting fish used to trap the beast .  the script ( and let's be clear here ) by devlin and emmerich is so full of plot holes and non characters as to be sure to be the recipient of next years " razzie " award .  the dialogue between maria pitillo ( as audrey timmonds , dr . tatopoulos' estranged girlfriend ) and mr . broderick is so adolescent , it makes teenagers giggle in disbelief ( as happened during the screening i witnessed ) .  the film could be enjoyably campy if it didn't take itself so damn seriously .  but to what end , as there is no commentary on humanities foibles against nature , nor is there any reference about godzilla being some sort of retaliation against mankind .  no . godzilla is just a big dummy that got knocked up by some french immigrants and decided to let the state of new york pay for it .  the film is bleak and ugly looking .  taking place at night during a rain storm , the movie has little or no depth .  everything is ugly and dark .  new york has never looked so inhospitable since " death wish " .  in an attempt to give the film some color , audrey timmonds carries a bright red umbrella which is unique in that everyone else in the film carries the standard gray issue .  the only moment of composition and color is during the brief scenes on jamaica , where dr . tatopoulos finds himself standing in a giant footprint .  the scene is nicely photographed but poorly set up .  you know from the outset that nick is standing in a footprint .  for a scientist , this is very poor observation .  let's look at some of the more interesting plot holes in the film ( this activity , is becoming almost as popular as the kevin bacon game ) :  1 . ) why does the french nuclear tests only affect one clutch of iguana eggs , and how do those eggs fuse into one beast ?  2 . ) why would a cold blooded creature choose a cold climate ( such as new york ) to nest ?  i don't think iguana's have a habit of migrating .  3 . ) how can godzilla crawl through the new york subway system , slice a submarine in half , yet be unable to extricate himself from some thin ( in comparison ) steel cable on the brooklyn bridge ?  4 . ) the brooklyn bridge is the only suspension bridge in existence that does not need it's suspension cables .  5 . ) did godzilla carry all two hundred eggs in her belly ?  if so , then radioactive mutations surely are wondrous creatures .   ( note : each egg is 10 feet tall and almost as wide .  godzilla would have to be over 1 , 000 feet tall to carry them all ) .  6 . ) godzilla can crush ships and eat helicopters , but new york cabs are made of stronger steel .  7 . ) godzilla can out maneuver helicopters , bullets , torpedoes and missiles , but can't catch you on foot .  8 . ) taxis can out maneuver godzilla .  9 . ) godzilla can burrow through the subway system but can't tear through the park avenue tunnel .  10 . ) why was nothing else mutated by the nuclear test as quickly as godzilla ?  maybe a giant hermit crab in the sequel .  11 . ) galapagos iguana's actually live in the french polynesian islands ?  12 . ) why was dr . tatopoulos brought in by the military if they were not going to listen to him anyway ?  13 . ) how did they evacuate new york island in less than a day , and how did they convince those new yorkers to go to new jersey ?  14 . ) new york television stations use vhs tape for both filming and broadcasting .  new yorkers hate beta cam .  i could go on and on , but that would only serve to make the film seem more enjoyable than it is .  don't be fooled , this film has less gray matter than any episode of " america's funniest home videos " .  the performances in the film are singularly bland .  not one performance belays any awe or fear in the face of this two hundred foot tall terror .  the characters , in the midst of the onslaught , have time to stop and discuss the lack of good coffee , failed relationships , career choices .  the only common occurrence that doesn't take place here is having one of the characters have a bowel movement , but then that would have made them believable .  godzilla for the most part is okay .  the design of the beast is funky , if not very memorable .  one thing that comes to mind-- the major redirection of godzilla in this film is to remove his most familiar trademark , namely his atomic breath .  now , i for one can't quite fathom how you can call this monster godzilla without that little trait .  a good comparison would be to make a superman film and eliminate his ability to fly .  there is so much wrong with this film that i can't really recall anything recently that has left me this cold hearted ( except for my divorce ) .  any film that can have a two ton lizard slipping on gum balls has got to be envisioned under the influence of prozac .  the addition of the baby raptors ( ah , i meant godzillas ) , are nothing but a direct rip off of 'jurassic park " , but with none of that film's suspense or tension .  suffice to say that , " godzilla " is without a doubt the most brain dead motion picture of the decade .  this is a film that needed the hype .  with the current level of writing and directing , nothing else about the film succeeds .  if you've seen the trailers , you've seen the best parts .  my only suggestion for mr . d and mr . e . is that they could always go back to selling shoes .   . this film could be the next " rocky horror " .  only it's not funny ! 
pos@ pos neg films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there's never really been a comic book like from hell before .  for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid '80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen .  to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd .  the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes .  in other words , don't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell's directors , albert and allen hughes .  getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in , well , anything , but riddle me this : who better to direct a film that's set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society ?  the ghetto in question is , of course , whitechapel in 1888 london's east end .  it's a filthy , sooty place where the whores ( called " unfortunates " ) are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision .  when the first stiff turns up , copper peter godley ( robbie coltrane , the world is not enough ) calls in inspector frederick abberline ( johnny depp , blow ) to crack the case .  abberline , a widower , has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium .  upon arriving in whitechapel , he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly ( heather graham , say it isn't so ) and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon can't stomach .  i don't think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper , so i won't go into the particulars here , other than to say moore and campbell have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay .  in the comic , they don't bother cloaking the identity of the ripper , but screenwriters terry hayes ( vertical limit ) and rafael yglesias ( les mis ? rables ) do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end .  it's funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because , after all , an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts .  and from hell's ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days ( " who holds back the electric car/who made steve guttenberg a star ? " ) .  don't worry - it'll all make sense when you see it .  now onto from hell's appearance : it's certainly dark and bleak enough , and it's surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did ( at times , it seems like sleepy hollow 2 ) .  the print i saw wasn't completely finished ( both color and music had not been finalized , so no comments about marilyn manson ) , but cinematographer peter deming ( don't say a word ) ably captures the dreariness of victorian-era london and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks , even though the violence in the film pales in comparison to that in the black-and-white comic .  oscar winner martin childs' ( shakespeare in love ) production design turns the original prague surroundings into one creepy place .  even the acting in from hell is solid , with the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent .  ians holm ( joe gould's secret ) and richardson ( 102 dalmatians ) log in great supporting roles , but the big surprise here is graham .  i cringed the first time she opened her mouth , imagining her attempt at an irish accent , but it actually wasn't half bad .  the film , however , is all good .  2 : 00 - r for strong violence/gore , sexuality , language and drug content 
neg@ pos neg battlefield long , boring and just plain stupid  battlefield earth  a film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman  in my mid-teen years , i had a horrendous re-occurring nightmare .  behind the wheel of a car , i was driving down a straight road in the middle of a desert .  no scenery except the horizon line and the converging parallel lines of the highway .  no matter what i did , the view didn't change : travelling but not getting anywhere .  each time i awoke in a sweat , terrified .  you don't have to be carl jung to understand that dream .  powerless to make changes , trapped in a boring situation with no hope of rescue , this is the stuff of nightmares whether we are asleep or awake .  this is exactly how you will feel 15 minutes after " battlefield earth " begins .  for all of its flash and style , l . ron hubbard's science fiction epic is the earliest and best entry for the dullest summer film of 2000 .  dull " and " stupid .  in the year 3000 , the psychlo aliens have ruled our planet for 1 , 000 years .  humans either work as slave labor in mining operations or live as barbarians .  there's no hope .  the future is bleak .  then the psychlo make a mistake and capture feisty jonnie goodboy tyler ( barry pepper ) who organizes a revolution against chief of security terl ( john travolta ) and the alien race .  it's an archetypal post-apocalyptic plot full of promise .  considering some of the talent involved and all the millions thrown at the screen , it's difficult to see how it could have failed so miserably .  but it does .  the story is so full of holes that it falls apart within minutes of the opening credits .  are we really supposed to believe that after a millennium of looking for gold , the psychlo never discovered fort knox ?  or that fighter planes are still in pristine condition after all that time -- and gassed up ?  or that the cavemen become such expert pilots in seven days that they can easily down the advanced alien ships ?  or that the psychlo spy cameras somehow don't notice that their slaves are missing for days ?  travolta prances across the screen hamming it up for all he's worth and is almost entertaining .  almost .  the rest of the actors are wooden mannequins trying not to laugh while delivering lines that no person -- " man-animal " or not -- would ever utter .  some of the film _looks_ good , but it also looks so familiar .  a race of large hulking ape-like creatures has taken over the world while our cities lie in ruin .  sound like something charlton heston might be in ?  the psychlo look like overweight klingons in gear from " dune " .  the final air battle between the air force fighters and the psychlo ships in their high-tech city is something george lucas might have been associated with .  it's too loud .  it's too oppressive .  it's too slow .  it's too long . . . far  too long .  and on it goes .  the list of the problems with " battlefield earth " is endless .  it's difficult to find anything in the film that does work .  oh yeah .  the color scheme is nice .  the real question is how this movie ever got made .  could it have something to do with the fact that l . ron hubbard was the founder of scientology ?  and that john travolta is a member of the church .  that might explain why travolta bought the rights to the novel years ago .  but it doesn't give us a clue as to why first-time screenwriter corey mandell's atrocious script was used .  or why the high-profile project was entrusted with roger christian who had never before directed a major film .  or why no one looked at this thing before it was released and realized there might be problems .  the one bright spot is that no longer will kevin costner's " the postman " ( which i begrudgingly admit as a guilty pleasure ) be " the " big budget science fiction failure .   " battlefield earth " has the honor sewed up .  often reviewers will recommend that you skip mediocre films and wait for the video .  that's not the case here .  you can act now and make the decision to not see it on the big screen or on the small one .  don't hesitate .  strike now while the iron is cold . 
pos@ pos neg note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers .  be forewarned .  on december 20 , 1996 , amidst all the year-end oscar bait releases from the major studios , miramax's genre label dimension films quietly released a sly little ensemble slasher flick titled scream .  although the teen horror market had been given up for all-but-dead in recent years , the film shocked industry observers by scoring consistently high box office returns , eventually topping $100 million domestic and becoming one of the most successful films of its type in history , while delighting audiences by finally presenting a set of knowing slasher flick protagonists who were aware of the all the standard cliches associated with the genre .  the sleeper success of scream sent shockwaves through the industry -- suddenly , everybody was looking for hip , inexpensive fright films that might be able to reap similar fortunes .  the strategy of casting young tv stars to draw the youth demographic was given a boost .  scream director wes craven , previously best known as the creator of new line's a nightmare on elm street film series , was thrust back into the limelight .  and scream's rookie scribe , kevin williamson , burst onto the film scene in stunning fashion .  it's hard to understate this last point .  mr . williamson has , based upon his produced screenplays as of this writing ( scream , i know what you did last summer from october 1997 , and now scream 2 ) , enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame , quickly become the most well-known screenwriter amongst the entertainment weekly-reading , box office figure-watching youth culture since -- well , since that quentin tarantino guy ( whom , it is said , has also achieved some renown as a director ) .  indeed , in a singularly freakish oddity , it is the screenwriter , mr . williamson , and not the director that has been receiving the lion's share of acclaim for the success of scream , and the print advertisements for scream 2's theatrical release are similarly indicative of his increasing prominence : while the traditional " a film by wes craven " drapes the film's title in the ads , right below it ( in equal sized font , yet ) reads " written by kevin williamson " , an affirmation of the screenwriter's contribution to the project which may be unprecedented .   ( i can envision the board of wga , licking their chops at this coup and counting the days until their goal of " a film by " is attained . )  and , much like mr . tarantino's screenwriting , mr . williamson's work is vaguely unconventional , incorporating both contemporary pop culture references and allusions to other films into the dialogue of his characters .  in scream , they satirically discussed other horror films ; here in the sequel , the characters discuss the relative merits of film sequels .  scream was written in 1995 during the infamous bob dole rampage against hollywood , and mr . williamson's rejection of this tirade clearly influenced the writing in both that film and this sequel .  while the sequel was planned from the outset -- a treatment of scream 2 was included when mr . williamson sold the screenplay for scream -- the basic premise for the film and the reunion of the surviving characters nevertheless seems extremely artificially contrived , and it's only at about the film's midway point when it becomes engaging .  like its predecessor , scream 2 opens with a splashy , eye-grabbing prologue which only vaguely ties into the film's principal narrative ; this time around , we're following the exploits of a young couple ( jada pinkett and omar epps ) attending a riotously gleeful sneak preview screening of stab ( a running film-within-a-film gag where the " true life " events behind the first film has been turned into a movie ) .  however , although it tries hard and has some good ideas -- the nightmarishly enthusiastic audience in the film vaguely reminded me of the one i was sharing the theatre with , and i was certainly thinking about gutting the overly-noisy person a few seats away myself after about fifteen minutes -- the prologue is a pale imitation of the bravura opening sequence in the original with drew barrymore ( where her performance not only convinced me that she * could * act , but was so good that it would rank among the best performances in a horror film that i've ever seen ) .  there are too many knowing , hip pop-culture references crammed into the scream 2 sequence , and the setup isn't nearly as cleverly frightening as scream's ; while the first film's preface dizzyingly built up to a final shot that was exhilaratingly terrifying , the payoff here is almost campily theatrical .  flash to the campus of a smalltown ohio college , where returning characters sidney ( neve campbell ) and randy ( jamie kennedy ) have relocated for their studies and to escape the notoriety from the events in the first film .  the murders which open this film result in reuniting the survivors -- single-minded tabloid tv reporter gale weathers ( courteney cox ) roars into town to cover the breaking story , while ever-awkward former deputy dewey riley ( david arquette ) flies in to protectively guard over sidney .  they're joined by cotton weary ( liev schreiber ) , who was falsely accused of homicide in a cameo appearance during the first film ; his role here is significantly expanded .  the film incidentally provides surprisingly little backstory , although i suppose a good case can be made that it really isn't necessary -- not because so many people have seen the first installment , but because this is , after all , a sequel to a slasher film : what do you * think * happened to these characters in the prior movie ?  there's a lot of new faces on the scene too : sidney's new boyfriend , derek ( jerry o'connell ) and her new roommate hallie ( elise neal ) , randy's fellow film student mickey ( timothy olyphant ) , gale's newly-assigned nervous cameraman joel ( duane martin ) , omnipresent local journalist debbie salt ( laurie metcalf ) , co-ed cici cooper ( ms . buffy herself , sarah michelle gellar ) , and a pair of simpering sorority sisters ( rebecca gayheart and sirens' portia di rossi ) .  any of these characters could be the killer -- or for that matter , could be the next victim .  as is seemingly becoming a regular staple of a kevin williamson screenplay , the narrative is once again framed around the increasingly-flimsy premise of a whodunit .  one problem that scream didn't have was keeping you interested in the identity of the killer .  here ( and to some extent in i know what you did last summer ) , mr . williamson's screenplay seems slightly hampered by trying to turn the identity of the killer into a mystery .  the film occasionally becomes so bogged down with misdirection that you can sense it straining at the seams to try and drop red herrings left and right at the expense of its thriller elements .   ( it doesn't help matters any that the killer's alter-ego is fairly obvious from the get-go . )  indeed , the finale plays as full-out camp when the villain is finally unmasked , frothing at the mouth with glazed eyes .  this is one of those cases where the villain goes on such an endless diatribe about their machinations , scheming , and motivation , that you actually get bored listening and just want them all to get on with it .  while the basic setup and premise for the film is fairly contrived , the aspect where it's head-and-shoulders above its predecessor is in its suspense sequences .  they're staged much more imaginatively here ( save for the first post-prologue murder , which is handled in such a mediocre , conventional fashion that it seems to be culled directly from the predictable 1980s slasher flicks that the first film satirized ) , and are much more fun to watch .  it's hard to hold back a smile during a giddy scene where sidney and her companion have to climb over the incapacitated killer in order to escape from a car wreck , and a cat-and-mouse chase involving gale and dewey in a campus sound lab is very nicely staged , although its ultimate resolution is hilariously overblown .  in terms of its characters , the strong part of the film is the interesting relationship between gale and dewey ( who ambles onto the screen accompanied by his very own theme music ) .  their verbal sparring at the outset provides much humour -- an exchange where dewey defensively rebukes charges of a perceived aura of incompetency is well-written -- and there's a curiously endearing aspect about their relationship amidst all the mayhem and bloodshed .  on the other hand , sidney is pretty dull here .  she doesn't have any compelling presence , and there's nothing particularly interesting about her this time around to make us care about her other than that she's the returning heroine .  given this , and the fact that there's no strong second banana character for sidney ( elise neal's role isn't nearly substantive enough to adequately fill rose mcgowan's shoes ) , it's no wonder why the roles for gale and dewey have been significantly augmented for this installment of the film .  what surprises me the most about scream 2 is its zealousness in decimating its cast .  the film's mounting body count bears out the fact that * no * character is safe ( well , * almost * ) ; while in principal i applaud this bold policy , at some point you've got to be wondering about just how many characters will make it to the next sequel .   ( i was particularly surprised with the untimely demise of one in particular , whose casting for the next installment of the series would've seemed obvious . )  but hey , as rose mcgowan's character said in the first film : " no , please don't kill me , mr . ghostface -- i want to be in the sequel ! "  look what that got her .

pos@ pos neg the uncompromising nudity bared throughout petrice chereau's intimacy has already garnered much notoriety , but it's in the naked faces of fearless actors mark rylance ( angels & insects ) and kerry fox ( welcome to sarajevo ) that the tender ache of emotional resonance is discovered .  with sharp , intelligent eyes that reflect experience and maturity , rylance and fox are refreshingly detached from the false glamour of hollywood idols .  their sex scenes together are bracing in their raw honesty , in the acceptance of flesh and messiness .  less apparent , but no less remarkable , are the astute observations of behavior revealed through those carnal beats of haste and hesitance , often without a single line of dialogue .  not aiming for the spiritual poetry of in the realm of the senses or the philosophical transgressions of crash , chereau keeps his sexual odyssey firmly grounded in terms of straightforward character development .  that may be the very reason why intimacy seems unerringly impressive but never particularly significant on more than a tactile , sensory level .  the themes of human isolation are barren and obvious , a science project devoid of any especially groundbreaking hypothesis .  intimacy does manage to stand out from lesser portraits of " human interconnectedness " and pinter-esque rummages through psychological dirty drawers ( okay , kill me ) .  shallow though it might sound , it's amazing how much is filled in through an inspired cast , perceptive camerawork , and imaginative ways of treating the love scene .  those ingredients are too assured and confident to merely dismiss as icing on the cake , especially since they are the substance of the cake itself .  adapted from a pair of short stories by british novelist hanif kureishi , intimacy weaves desperate lovemaking between two strangers in london .  every wednesday , jay ( rylance ) and claire ( fox ) meet in his cluttered , dank apartment for an hour or two of sexual release from their uninspired lives .  he's been head bartender at a posh restaurant for over six years .  she's a mystery to him but her glum workaday appearance reveals a similar dissatisfaction .  they're both married , but his relationship has curdled into an embittered separation .  as the weeks draw on , jay obsessively takes it upon himself to uncover claire's personal routines .  in his attempt to gain a fuller semblance of who she is , he opens wounds that hadn't existed before by single-handedly corrupting the fantasy .  if it weren't for a few unnecessary subplots involving jay's brother and his bevy of disgruntled co-workers , this minimalist premise might be described as a modern fable on the perils of wish fulfillment .  chareau's restless camera ( once again wielded by superb and ever-attentive cinematographer eric gautier ) is less appropriate here than in his family transit-oriented those who love me can take the train .  the scenes that linger are the still ones where rylance and fox separately , pensively attempt to carry on with their makeshift household routines .  these are often captured in lingering , unblinking wide shots that view them stranded amidst their drab workplaces and homes .  separation proves haunting in a melancholy series of intercut shots as rylance and fox undress on opposite sides of the room , crawling across the floor to meet in the center .  despite being as restless as a fly during the hyperactive restaurant scenes ( all the better to blend in with a hustling crowd of gabby trendsetters ) , you'd be hard pressed to find a single uninteresting image .  intimacy takes an interest in its sordid world of the lower-middle class , with lonely pubs and busy shopping streets -- it also understands the people who inhabit those spaces , viewing them with sympathy scraped raw .  an evaluation would be incomplete without highlighting the great timothy spall ( the robust scene-stealer of many a mike leigh collaboration ) .  as claire's cuckolded husband , this jocular heavyweight plays out his handful of bitter pill scenes with the unforced menace and self-effacing embarrassment of his imposing bulk .  bangs in his eyes , his mouth forming into quizzical pouts and dry smirks , he may seem the fool in his barroom encounters opposite a sarcastic , gleaming mark rylance ( whose jay has arrived on the scene looking to stir up some trouble ) , but spall is no one to trifle with .  his overreaching best pal demeanor suggests a mind abuzz with secret passageways of guile , his pointed questions only na ? ve if you choose not to read into their crafty insinuations .  in his unassuming way , spall's carefully etched interpretation of hostility buried under a mountain of surface propriety may become one of the most criminally underappreciated performances of the year , but maybe also one of the best .  he's that good . 
neg@ pos neg i wish i could have been in the pitch meeting for this ridiculous notion of a sports film .  i bet it was some hotshot warner brothers agent with an dark armani suit and manicured fingernails saying , " it would be a very light comedic version of any given sunday , and we could throw in the hoosiers angle with the casting of gene hackman as the tough but determined coach .  throw in that hunk of a guy keanu reeves and a cast of wacky characters and poof !  we'll have a hit on our hands ! "  the replacements is a hokey mistake of a football film , a mishmash collage of one-dimensional characters , rampant stereotypes of cultures and races , cliched emotional statements of purpose , and keanu reeves wishing for the matrix sequel to start principal photography .  the story is loosely based around the pro football players' strike in 1987 and a rag-tag team of replacement football players taking up the reins of professional play for a variety of teams with names like the washington sentinels .  keanu reeves stars as shane falco , a has-been football college player looking for redemption .  gene hackman dons a fedora like tom landry and speaks with gusto like a certain coach in hoosiers .  rounding out the cast includes swingers' jon favreau , 7-up pitchman orlando jones , gruff owner jack warden , and cast of wacky and unknown actors who do amazing jobs of portraying perfectly stereotyped characters : the drunken welshman , the overweight sumo wrestler , the black convict , the violent cop , and the dumb , dumb cheerleaders .  this bunch of nobodies try to make something of themselves by taking the team to the season playoffs with unbelievable football plays , gene hackman yelling and asking himself where the hell dennis hopper is , keanu reeves looking for his body double making him look good on the football field , and cheerleaders hired from the local strip club making the girls from coyote ugly look like waitresses from denny's .  the usual things happen like clockwork .  the hero rises from the ashes of failure , the team comes together in unity , the hero falls in love with a conventional love interest , the football games are won with enough schlock value to make the most ignorant of audiences cheer and clap , and the cheerleaders make you want to go home and watch late night movies on cinemax .  it's also a shame when decent directors with good movies under their belts go to seed and become television and sequel hacks .  howard deutch , who was behind the camera for two of the best films of '80s - pretty in pink and some kind of wonderful , has since been doing grumpier old men and caroline in the city episodes .  obviously the problem is that without a good script , any director will fail in the end .  sports films are strong vehicles for cinematic glory , gritty tales involving the honor of men and the valiant efforts taken for the ultimate goal of victory in the face of insurmountable odds , the rise and fall of gallant heroes , and stories of dramatic gusto painted with blood and sweat on the battlefield of life .  the replacements offers none of this . 
pos@ pos neg i have to admit that i disliked this film initially .  it certianly isn't for every taste , and it's sheer torture to sit through if you're in a restless mood .  that said , if you are in the right mood , it's absolutely incredible .  this was my second favorite movie of 1998 , and would have been a shoo-in for first in almost any other year .  perhaps the big turn-off for many was this film's unconventionality .  i'd be hard-pressed to compare it to any other film that i've seen - it is very , very artsy , incredibly slow - and amazingly , it works beautifully .  on my second viewing , i realized that the film follows the three act structure ( i didn't think it had any sort of structure at all when i first saw it ) .  the first act serves to set up the characters - sort of .  it exists even moreso to set a mood of tension and restlesness , and perhaps even feelings of boredom .  and then it is shattered by the intense violence of the second ( which encompasses most of the movie ) .  the majority of the film is one extended battle scene , intercut with brief flashbacks and voice-overs .  the artsier elements do not detract from the action , but add to it - they succeed in briefly letting the viewer peek into the minds of the soldiers , only to be suddenly yanked back into reality when the battle resumes .  the battle scenes are amazing ( second only to " saving private ryan " in my opinion ) .  they're brutal , horrifying , and at times beautiful due to the amazing cinematography .  the second act is as immersive , brilliant , and haunting as any film that i have ever seen .  the only problems come during the first and third acts .  malick takes a little too long to get the film started .  although the initial scenes - which consist of two soldiers' experiencing a near-eden-like paradise while going awol , and the preperations for battle - are effective and necessary , hints of pretentiousness sink in .  the film is just a tad too artsy near the beginning , and a lot of people that disliked the movie probably gave up on it because of this .  the final act is effective at winding the film down , but the problems from the first persist - it's a bit too long , and comes over as pretentious at times .  that said , there are two sequences ( one where a soldier gets a devastating note from his wife , and another where one of the main characters is killed ) that are nothing short of incredible .  the performances are phenominal all around .  the two standouts are nick nolte and newcomer jim caviezel , both of whom should have been nominated for oscars .  nolte is riveting and intense as the colonel in charge of the operation .  his character is hard , mean , and somewhat reckless with the lives of his men , and yet nolte somehow manages to evoke sympathy for him .  caviezel is forever questioning the nature of war , his place in it , and if there's any deeper meaning to the hell that he's going through .  he is absolutely perfect - genuine , sympathetic , sincere , and yet strong when he needs to be .  although restricted to a relatively small role , sean penn is also very good as the company's pessimistic seargent .  as to how it stacks up to " saving private ryan " - it was my second favorite movie of 1998 , " ryan " was my first .  it's really hard to compare the two - they are so , so different - so i won't , beyond saying that spielberg's film had more of an impact on me .  however , the two are comparable from the standpoint of quality ( i can easily see why someone would " the thin red line " above " ryan ) .  i highly recommend both of them , and consider them to be the two best war movies ever made .  all in all , " the thin red line " is filmmaking of an incredibly high order .  it's slight faults are easily offset by the sheer brilliance of what is done right .  it's a real shame that it tanked at the box office - films this unconventional , powerful , and thought-provoking don't come along very often . 
neg@ pos neg long ago , films were constructed of strong dialogue , original characters , memorable plot points , and solid acting .  one of the best examples that hollywood now completely ignore these qualities is found in the new film where the heart is .  this opus about the power of love and the redemption of family follows the tragic , and i mean tragic , life of novalee nation ( natalie portman ) .  hitting the road with her hick , guitar-playing boyfriend in a rusted-out gm , novalee dreams of the blue skies of bakersfield and sipping chocolate milk beneath a plastic umbrella with her unborn baby , due in a month .  stopping off at a nearby wal-mart for a quick rest , novalee's boyfriend decides to take off and leaves her there .  novalee then decides to secretly hole up in the wal-mart ( because she's not the brightest bulb in the stagelights ) .  a wacky librarian ( keith david ) comes to her rescue when she goes into labor one night while she is camped in the outdoors section of the store .  then the she moves in with a family , befriends everyone in town -- including ashley judd's character ( who has five kids and still can work part-time as a nurse ) -- fights off religious freaks , survives a tornado , breaks the heart of the wacky librarian that saved her , receives an inheritance , builds a martha stewart-esque house , becomes an award-winning photographer , and manages to always look like she stepped out of a cosmo shoot , all while not once doing anything with her kid .  this film is terrible .  the directing is awful : it seems director matt williams had an index card with six angles written on it and used every one of them , over and over and over again .  we get pathetic and ugly acting by natalie portman , who can do good work .  a disjointed pacing of key scenes and a time structure so confusing that it would throw steve prefontaine off .  a subplot that actually validates the actions of the boyfriend who abandoned novalee in the wal-mart parking lot .  an embarrassing display of emotions by the characters , making the audience ill .  taking two great comedic screenwriters , babaloo mandel and lowell ganz , and forcing them to write drama on par with oprah's book club .  altogether , it has the feeling of being trapped at home , watching a very bad television mini-series and wishing it to end , only the remote is broken .  however , the main problem with the film is that it never answers the most poignant question brought up : where is the heart ?  no one ever seems to find it in this piece of junk . 
pos@ pos neg the grandfather of italian horror the late mario bava has credits in nearly 100 films and tv movies produced in italy between 1939 and his death in the early 80's .  more practiced as a cinematographer than a director , bava nonetheless sat in the director's chair for beyond the door ii , the project which turned out to be his last full-length feature film .  alongside the appalling zombie schlock of hacks like lucio fulci , beyond the door ii is simply a revelation .  in his day bava was considered by most to be no great filmmaker , yet here he fashioned one of the finest italian horror movies of the 1970's .   ( note that the film has no connection with the 1975 exorcist-rip off behind the door , but for some unexplained reason was given this related title for release in the usa and australia . )  this story focuses on dora , a women set upon by a malevolent spirit that channels itself through her young son marco .  the film opens with dora , her son and second husband bruno returning to a house by the sea that was the scene of her first husband's suicide and her subsequent trauma 7 years earlier .  they hope to put the past behind them , but as small accidents start to befall dora - usually while bruno is away on business - she starts to suspect that marco ( played with uncanny ability by 8 year old david colin jr . ) is somehow involved in the strange goings on .  to reveal any more of the story would be unfair .  suffice to say that this artfully paced study of a woman suffering a nervous breakdown offers an intriguing plot , loads of atmosphere and solid acting , though the dialogue is somewhat weakened by the dubbing into english .  bava coaches a surprisingly good performance from the usually wooden daria nicolodi , wife of famed italian horror director dario argento .  her character is invested with sufficient depth to allow the audience real empathy with dora's troubled soul .  the music by italian ensemble libra is also effective , mixing odd-sounding 70's rock with classic gothic piano sequences .  and there is at least one moment - brilliantly engineered by bava - that is guaranteed to lift you ten feet out of your chair .  yet for italian horror , the bloodletting here is surprisingly minimal .  lamberto bava and francesco barbieri's script is more concerned with deeper , psychological terrors , with themes of guilt and suffering , with the notion that what we sow will shall - somewhere , somehow - eventually reap .  scholars of the genre take note : beyond the door ii is stylish , chilling , and essential . 
neg@ pos neg one of the 90s' most unwelcome thriller trends returns from the grave : it's the " ___ from hell " movie !  starting in the early nineties , we were subjected to nearly every conceivable combination of relationships-from-hell !  there were boyfriends from hell , friendly neighborhood cops from hell , nannies from hell , and even secretaries from hell .  but hush has found an old standby that somehow was forgotten in the rush : the mother-in-law from hell ! ! ! ! !  the mother-in-law in question is martha , played by jessica lange .  she has been single-handedly running the family horse farm , kilronan .  her son , jackson ( johnathon schaech ) and his girlfriend , helen ( gwyneth paltrow ) , live in new york , and have no intention to move back down south to the rural kilronan .  but those intentions are about to change .  you see , martha lives by manipulation .  she has used it in years past to breed many championship horses .  now , she believes she can use it to breed herself a grandson .  though at first , helen finds martha charming , soon she is caught in the domineering martha's web of deception .  it's hard to understand why nobody ever wises up to martha' schemes .  as written , most of the characters in the film must be very slow witted .  but then , the film even treats the audience like idiots .  it tries to get away with things ( like leaving a critical piece of evidence in a rather unlikely place ) without even batting an eye .  then again an audience which accepts characters as shallow as these isn't one that's likely to question details .  jessica lange's martha is the only semi-developed character in the film , and she applies her talents to redeem it as much as she can .  a character that could have been simply awful is merely groan-worthy .  gwyneth paltrow doesn't have much to build upon , as helen's only character trait seems to be " daughter-in-law " .  still , she fares better than johnathon schaech , whose character is so nonexistent , he's inexplicably missing for much of the film .  still , there have been much worse " ____ from hell " films .  even with its paper-thin characters and ludicrous setups , hush manages to create a few thrills in a color-by-numbers fashion .  you know what's coming , but occasionally the film will deliver a shock or two .  the old formulas are around for a reason , but that doesn't mean they taste fresh . 
pos@ pos neg this is a film about secrets , some that are innocent like those of a cute little farm girl , frances boyd ( ashley ) .  others that are between a married couple that is impacting their relationship , like the problems of infertility affecting this upwardly mobile couple , geoffrey gaines ( stephen ramsey ) , the medical researcher working for a big corporation called fex and striving to get a patent for his experiment and become recognized in his field , and his artist wife , lillian ( miriam healy-louie ) , who reluctantly stands behind her husband suppressing her natural artistic tendencies in order to make the marriage work .  and , still other secrets that have a greater implication for the world and are deadly in a political sense , of science carried out by the big corporations like it was a business run for the bottom line .  receiving a summer grant to study " chemo-electric therapy , " geoffrey and his wife are hoping that a summer spent away from the intensity of the big city will bring back the romance that is dwindling from their marriage and that the casualness of the country atmosphere will give them more time together , as their three-year marriage has become shaky because he is more interested in his work than he is in her .  he has slyly managed to keep his work as secretive as possible by locking himself in the lab , which is off limits to her , as he secretly goes about conducting experiments on rats and mice , convincing her that what he is doing is to benefit humanity with possible new treatments and cures to illnesses .  his main argument is , that this is what the public wants , they don't want to hear about how some animals had to die because of these experiments , they just want the benefits of science .  that he is depicted as a monster creating another monster , much like frankenstein was created , is the argument skewed by the director against his bad science ( science as a business ) as opposed to the good science ( science that cares about the small farmer ) , which is represented by the handsome and almost perfect gentleman , alex vine ( david ) , a young ecologist who chooses to work in the field , trying to get the farmers to go back to organic farming .  he is hired by the university to monitor the dangers of pesticides and all the chemicals the farmer is almost forced to use to survive financially , as it is doing irreparable harm to him and the consumer because of all the health risks attached to this new way of farming , methods that have just come about in the last thirty- years and are being pushed by the big companies to enhance their profit margins .  the third view in all this is the artist's , represented by lillian , who points out that the artist's work is shown in public and scrutinized constantly , " why shouldn't the same be true of the scientist ? "  she argues that the artist is the watchdog for the public , questioning what is good or evil in society , something that bad science has completely ignored .  geoffrey , impatient to get ahead with his research , feels bogged down by the bureaucrats in his firm who fail to provide him with the three chimps he needs to experiment on , as he contacts one of the company's higher ups to argue his case , but decides he can't wait any longer for their help , so he sets an animal trap in the countryside and catches chester , the gorgeous pet dog of frances , a dog that means so much to her and her family because he saved her life .  while out in the field with the bloodied trapped dog already in the back seat of his car , he is spotted by alex and one of his co-workers , and nervously invites them to dinner with his wife , afraid that alex will spot what he is doing , as he rushes away from the area .  in the dinner scene that was , unfortunately , flatly done , but was nevertheless the heart of the film , as all the main characters get a chance to speak out from the point of view they represent as they eat meat , a means of getting protein that the radical scientists have eschewed since they became so politically correct about everything .  the scientists engage in a rational argument , highlighting their different points of view , while lillian reacts in an emotional way , siding mostly with david's view but coming at it from a much different angle .  it was as if the actors were puppets on strings that the director controlled and they just spewed out their generalized philosophies .  that the director's point of view is absolutely right , is beside the point .  the point is that the characters lost their humanity and became one-dimensional characters .  geoffrey was likened to a hideous monster , alex vine was likened to his last name , the one who holds fast to the ground ensuring that the plant has stability , while lillian was likened to the muse of poetry and art , the inspiration for goodness and beauty .  alex has been spending a lot of time together with lillian , as these two seem to share the same views and are physically attracted to each other , but when the time is ripe for an affair to take place between them , lillian changes her mind and decides not to go up to alex's apartment .  geoffrey is already suspicious of alex and considers him an enemy , and the marriage seems to be coming apart and all his cunning tricks to possess her are no longer working , as it is now impossible to see any good in him and there becomes no reason why she would remain with him .  the relationship has disintegrated way beyond the point of her just feeling lonely .  the dog is discovered by alex and her in a deplorable state after geoffrey is seen by them electrically shocking it , and mercifully the dog dies .  the only thing left for her to do is walk out of the marriage , but she also fails to respond to david's loving gesture for her to stay with him , instead opting to head back to the city .  the farmer whose dog was tortured to death comes into the scientist's lab and knocks him cold while he was in the middle of a phone conversation with one of the higher-ups who told him all the animals he needs are on the way .  what is progress ?  what can one expect out of life ?  is the small farmer about to become extinct ?  the answers to these questions can best be answered by either good science or art , which are both closely related to the american natives vision of a world entrusted to mankind so that he can respect it and take care of it and enrich it with his creations to benefit mankind in a peaceful way .  that this work fails to be subtle and polarizes opinions , leaving no room for deeper arguments , is the shame of this decent and smart film , that tried so hard to say what it felt it had to say but said it so loudly without trusting its audience to catch on to its message by not making everything seem so black and white .  no telling said a lot about the harmful trends it sees science going in ; it probably said too much and would have been better off if its vision was more poetical and less didactic .  there is something about listening to a lecture that turns off the rebel in me , as i don't like being hit in the head with the truth but prefer to have it presented in the form that leads to inspiration or told metaphorically .  that is not to say that i found the film without considerable merit , that inspite of its shortcomings , it was worth seeing because of its visual statements , though they were also not too subtle , they were at least effective in setting up the intense mood that the film needed to show that there is a mental war going on currently , of those who believe one way is right and others who differ with them , and that anyone who is neutral must be considered an enemy because of their indifference .  the stakes in this ecological struggle are that high .  perhaps the most powerful visual statement in the film , was the dead cow from pesticides shown in the opening scene .  it was the image that lillian spent her time painting all summer and had the same affect for her as did the animal faces in picasso's guernica had for him .  both artists envisioned the horrors that man could do against the world , and represented this unspoken pain on the faces of the animals so that anyone who cares to really see what is going on , will not mistake which side of the fence he or she should be on .  the pain that lillian feels , as she forgets about her desires to raise a family , and she stares at her painting of the cow and the song , " make the world go away " blares out from the background , after she has learned that frances' beautiful and loving dog has been brutalized by her monster of a husband , all in the name of science , had a raw power to it that personalizes the dangers of bad science .  perhaps , the most pertinent question the film asks , requires an answer that must be resolved by the farmers and the consumers who are most caught in the changing world and its new way of doing business , as the question becomes , can science be happily married with art ? 
neg@ pos neg in the continuation of warner brother's franchise , joel schumacher has successfully killed this cash cow .  what makes this film such a grand disappointment is the tremendous line up of talented people involved with the film .  avika goldsman's screenplay is such a cluttered mess that there is no suspense built from one scene to another .  this coming on the heals of such a marvelously written project as " the client " is such a shock that it gives rise to thoughts that the latter film was a fluke .  situations are developed and executed with no thought of reason other that to get the characters from one point to another .  this is most glaringly brought to point by the appearance of alicia silverstone's batgirl , who just happens to be alfred's niece .  the story of dr . victor freeze is told almost completely in dialogue as an afterthought .  while working on a cure for a tragic decease contracted by his wife , dr . freeze is injured during a cryogenic procedure , and becomes a man who can only survive in a sub zero environment .  now of course he has become a terrorist intent on turning the world into a frozen planet where only he can live .  now the logic of that little sub-plot escapes me .  if mr . freeze wanted to find a cure for his wife and bring her back from the brink of death , why would he want to have her live in a world with no warmth .  this is indeed a cold hearted man .  the development of poison ivy is no less contradictory .  she wants to breed a form of plant life that can defend itself like an animal .  she joins with mr . freeze in his plan to start a new ice age , destroying all animal life , therefore giving her plant creations no reason to have the defense mechanism she had been trying to breed into them .  the characters have no logic .  batman of course is no longer the dark knight of the earlier films .  now that he has an adoptive son in burt ward / robin , bruce wayne is trying to be a father figure , constantly spouting out homilies about family and relationships , while at the same time not really having any .  george clooney tries in vain to keep from rolling his eyes while reciting the dialogue given him .  to say that his performance is workman-like is to be generous .  his best performances are still on " e . r . " .  bruce wayne has the most unromantic evening with his girlfriend ( played by elle macpherson ) , that it brings into question bruce's latent homosexuality .  there is no spark and no passion ( as there was for nicole kidman's psychologist in " batman forever " ) between bruce and anyone other than alfred .  and even that relationship is very reserved .  robin comes off less charismatic that in the last film in the series .  now he's just a spoiled kid .  in " batman forever " , burt ward wanted to be batman's partner and friend .  now , robin is suffering from ego deficiency .  robin's attraction for poison ivy is not believable , except for a boy around the age of 15 .  his later flirtation with batgirl smacks of incest , even though they are not related in a traditional sense .  chris o'donnell , once considered a rising star , successfully burns up on reentry with this performance .  his robin needs nothing more than a good spanking .  the less said about alicia silverstone's performance the better .  this talented young actress reads her lines with all the aplomb of a dubbing actor for a godzilla film .  she was cast strictly for her commercial value and she knew it .  this brings us to the villains .  arnold scharzenegger walks through his part with all the concern of someone waiting for payday .  the most rediculous scene is during mr . freeze's imprisonment .  the guards are at least a foot taller that arnold and yet fall at his hand in one of the most unbelievable fights scenes caught on film .  it's almost as ludicrous as seeing michael jackson as a gang member .  umu thurman struts and coos her way through her part , showing a growing discomfort with her sex symbol status .  her poison ivy has all the come hither sex appeal of may west in " sextette " ( 1978 ) .  the only performances worthy of notice are pat hingle and michael gough .  these two seasoned veterans carry their scenes with a dignity sorely lacking from the rest of the film .  without going through the intricacies of the plot , there is one question that always comes to mind with this series ( except for the first " batman " ) , and that is how do these super villains manage to hire so many thugs only to abandon them at the final reel .  mr . freeze is introduced with a team of hockey playing hoodlums that seem to have stepped out of an old kiss music video .  every villain ( even the minor ones ) have to have a look , no one can be an individual with day glow paint on their face or some sort of elaborate costume .  with this film , warner brothers has succeeded in retrograding the series back to it's tv incarnation .  the only thing missing from the action scenes are the superimposed titles detailing the pows ! ,  gwaaaa's , and clang's associated with the old series .  you almost wonder if william dozier , producer of the tv series is collecting royalties from this film .  the special effects ( by john dykstra ) and production design ( by barbara ling ) are the primary stars of this film .  and it is a case of extravagance in the pursuit of nothing .  every set , from ivy's lair , the batcave , to freeze's hideout is set with enough neon and fiberglass to keep the epa in paperwork for years to come .  there is no one realistic set or set piece in the film .  everything is set for maximum exposure .  the special effects have that strange cartoon look that most rushed cgi effects have .  there are homage thrown in by dykstra and his team to gene warren and his work on " the time machine " ( the growing plant scene ) but these scenes are so wroth with glaring color and art that they are almost obscured .  joel schumacher has directed the film with no flair .  camera angles are poorly chosen rehashing set ups from the old tv series .  master shots pepper the action scenes , destroying any flow of kinetic quality they may have had .  mr . schumacher is a good director .  one just has to look back on the films " the lost boys " , " cousins " ( an underrated film ) and " the client " to know that .  but " batman and robin " comes off as a mated made for tv movie .  the film has no style of individuality .  it is the cinematic equivalent to jell-o , pretty to look at , but empty .  it is unfortunate that this film , even with it's surprisingly strong box office has succeeded in doing what warner's thought tim burton would do with the franchise .  kill it .  joel schumacher's " batman & robin " is loud , colorful , action packed , and ultimately . .  boring .  stars . 
pos@ pos neg eric rohmer's " pauline at the beach , " is one of those small , deliberately paced , but charming foreign films in which not much happens plot wise , but a lot happens to the characters emotionally .  the film takes place during a few weeks of august at the normandy coast , and centers on six different characters , primarily pauline ( amanda langlet ) , a wise beyond her years 15-year-old who has come to stay for the summer with her older cousin , marion ( arielle dombasle ) .  on the first day at the beach , marion runs into an old high school flame ( fedoore atkine ) , and although he wants to rekindle their relationship , she is more interested in an older , more seductive womanizer ( pascal greggory ) , who is also secretly having an affair with a candy vendor ( rosette ) .  while pauline watches as an outsider at what is happening between all of the adults , she forms a relationship of her own with a young teenage boy ( simon de la brosse ) .   " pauline at the beach , " is not a film in which big dramatic things occur , and there is not a clear-cut , tidy conclusion to the story .  instead , it is a picture that simply observes its characters in every day life , and the surprises come from little character details . the film is quite talky and slow moving , and so it is pretty safe to say it isn't for those who are only a fan of action movies , but is a treat for those viewers who often like to venture outside of the big-budget genre and see a good art film .  this is the first film by acclaimed director eric rohmer ( 1969's " my night at mauds , " and 1971's " claire's knee " ) that i have seen , but his direction is assured and intelligent , as is the screenplay , which he also wrote .   " pauline at the beach , " is a film worth seeing .

" twilight " wants very much to be a 1940's film noir with alan ladd or dick powell .  all of the standard tropes are here : a hard-boiled p . i .  among the rich and beautiful whose glamour hides sinister secrets , a femme fatale who tempts and confounds the hero , shadowy figures shooting from doorways , dead bodies confronting the hero at every turn , cops dogging his path and interfering with his investigation .  the script offers little originality , and co-authors benton and richard russo seem unaware that what was original in 1948 is a clich ? in 1998 .  elmer bernstein's score is hauntingly melodic and could have been drawn note-for-note from a vintage noir .  the lead actors try hard-none of the three has every made less than a full effort , even when burdened with a bad script .  they try to invest every line and gesture with meaning , and they create a convincing sense of the relationships between the main characters .  harry is fond of jack but is in love with catherine .  jack is dying of cancer and is jealous of harry's love for catherine .  catherine teases harry and enjoys his attention , but her real feelings are hidden beneath a carefully-maintained veneer .   " twilight " wants to be character-driven like " nobody's fool " ( also directed by benton , also starring newman , based on a novel by russo ) was , but the tired script gives the actors too little to work with .   " twilight " also squanders a fine supporting cast : stockard channing ( harry's friend on the police force ) , reese witherspoon ( jack & catherine's bratty kid ) , giancarlo esposito ( the humorous sidekick ) , john spencer ( harry's nemesis on the force ) , liev schreiber and margo martindale ( the blackmailers ) , and james garner ( a cop who bailed movie stars out of trouble ) .

"  -jackson pollock to a life magazine reporter on recognizing when you've completed a painting  jackson pollock's " making love " quote is famous , but in practically the same breath , he said a more constructive thing , " it's like looking at a bed of flowers--tear your hair out over what it means . "  it took him sixteen words to do as whole dissertations have tried and failed : equate god and abstract art and offer a kind of backhanded comfort to those confused to the point of resentment by the concept .  the biopic _pollock_ , actor ed harris' directorial debut , reflects the second soundbite in how it accepts pollock's creations as part of the order of things , and should similarly disarm haters of fine art .  arguably more than any other living actor , harris , who also plays _pollock_ , embodies the archetypal working stiff , and his blue-collar demystification of pollock's labour-intensive art , both as performer and director , makes for unpretentious cinema .   ( from what i know of harris , he , like pollock , was not born gifted or lucky ; instead , a strong work ethic is the seed of his success . )  granted , it's possible that _pollock_ will alienate those same viewers perplexed by the imponderable " purpose " of pollock's splatter series : the common thread between them is a lack of editorializing .  the movie _pollock_ is all purposeful gazes and silent exchanges dotted by tantrums , but the motivations are left to our own perceptions .  and it is a sympathetic yet not altogether forgiving film , as illustrated by a disheartening conclusion .  _pollock_ encapsulates the period in which he fought a losing battle against personal demons ( alcoholism , depression , and the general attendant miseries of an artist ) while finding a place of subconscious expression .  a brief introduction to pollock's raging drunk side segues into his getting accosted by a fellow new york artist , lee krasner ( marcia gay harden , awarded a best supporting actress oscar for this brilliant portrayal ) , who works from the outside-in , pre-intellectualizing every stroke of her brush .  in a scene after they have moved in together and established adjoining studios , she asks what he hopes to achieve on his latest canvas , grilling him about the interplay of cubism and surrealism until he says , " you paint the fucking thing , " and leaves in a huff .  by the time they wed , she has become his de facto manager ; it is form marrying function and chaos marrying discipline , a most harmonious collision .   ( krasner denies him a baby , indicating that it would upset the balance . )  such a union is destined to implode , and i hope i'm not ruining the _pollock_ experience by saying that it does .  while it is never depicted as a very romantic matrimony to start--pollock and wife channel their passions elsewhere--their symbiosis leaves each other picked dry after several years , and it comes down to krasner suffering one of pollock's conniptions too many : " you are killing me !  you are killing me !  you are killing me ! "   ( aside : harris' own wife , amy madigan , is unrecognizable and exceptional as gallery diva peggy guggenheim . )  pollock himself moves on to dalliances with younger women like ruth klingman ( the scorching jennifer connelly ) , hoping , one supposes , to catch the revitalizing whiff of youth .  i love jackson pollock's stuff and i am enamoured of harris' _pollock_ as well .  it's scrappy and observant ; no coincidence that its minor failings are the occasional invasive flourish , such as jeff beal's hummable but no less lamentable score--i can't imagine that pollock , or anyone , would paint to this music , which puts filling soundtrack voids ahead of complementing the images .  one of my favourite sequences is an eerily quiet re-enactment of hans namuth shooting that famous pollock footage in east hampton , long island ; the mounting tension is almost comic , as namuth keeps interrupting pollock's process to reload his camera or take a dinner break .  a more seasoned director might've been too arrogant to admit that not all artists or mediums are created equal .

"  after making " mission : impossible " , brian de palma has a lot to live up to .  by making an epic science fiction and inviting great cast and talented crew , he hopes to reach the modern audience .  and the possibilities are certainly there , but the result is a great disaster .  starting in a near future , with a prologue copied from " apollo 13 " , de palma slowly builds up his " story " .  the human race has already set foot on mars .  a research expedition has vanished without trace on the red planet and another one has been sent to find out what happened .  this is basically the whole plot .  so it's hard to imagine that it can be stretched to 2 hours .  but de palma manages to do that .  it is not a very good achievement .  as we follow this expedition to mars and watch them slowly float in space , the hardest thing to do is stay awake .  the film's major problem is that it tries to seem more clever than it is .  david mamet's dialogue , while trying to seem natural , is distant and simply fake .  de palma and mamet wanted to combine action with a thought provoking plot .  the result is more like an unsuccessful mutation of kubrick's " 2001 : a space odyssey " , " apollo 13 " and " godzilla " .  to make time pass , the creators have inserted several " refreshing " scientific details , that would not convince a half-crazed frog .  it consists of multiple copies and direct ripp-offs from several great science fiction films and stories .  when it finally presents an almost original idea , it falls flat because of its uncovered stupidity .  i can't even call this film predictable , since no one with a healthy imagination can come up with something like this .  sometimes it gets so cheesy , that you'll start laughing when you're supposed to cry and cry when you're supposed to laugh .  you'll see enormous sandstorms , hear mysterious sounds and , last but not least , on this " constantly surprising " tour you'll see -- an alien .  it's really hard to find comparisons to such an experience , and i know that i've never said that before ( i thought i never would ) , but " lost in space " is actually better .  that's an achievement in itself !  director brian de palma has stroke gold with " untouchables " that became an instant american classic .  it is for this film that he will be remembered , while all his other failures will be forgotten .  he'll live to fight another day !  i send the actors my condolences , since they truly do try to transform into their undeveloped and dull characters .  and both the cinematography , production design and art direction are very decent .  it is because of the achievement of 254 people , that i rate this film 2/10 .  unfortunately their hard work was in vain .  if you have problems with insomnia , i recommend you this film .  if you're not asleep within the first half hour , consult your doctor . 
pos@ pos neg albert brooks saves the day , just in the nick of time .  with a very poor summer for movies , brooks is just what audiences were looking for to cheer them up , and does so in a positive way .  while this may not be his finest work , " the muse " still shakes up some delightful humor .  in albert brook's latest comedy , he tells a story of a troubled screenwriter ( brooks ) who's losing his edge , as his business partners say .  in desperation , he goes to see his friend jack ( jeff bridges ) , who has been a very successful screenwriter in the past .  he asks jack for some help , and recieves word of a real life muse , that has helped him and many other directors throughout their career .  so brooks seeks the muse named sarah ( sharon stone ) , and is suckered into buying her expensive , food etc . as a sort of payment .  the real punch line however , doesn't come until the end .  it really makes you wonder , how screenwriters really get their ideas , could it simply be from a friend or a bum in the street ?  the idea itself is provoking and brooks does it in a hilarious manner .  speaking of brooks , he was absolutely hysterical as a screenwriter .  every time he graces the screen , i can't help but start laughing .  albert has a very unique sense of humor that makes him a very likeable character .  the real problem with the film lies with sharon stone .  she wasn't likeable at all .  brooks had the right idea with her occupation , but she never pulled through .  in a way , she drained energy from the once funny atmosphere and left it bleak .  luckily brooks could clean up the mess , and cover for stone's mishap .  it was a shame that the film went slightly downhill after her appearance , because " the muse " had the potential to a be a very authentic comedy .  on a brighter note , andie macdowell was also charming as brook's wife .  she is always a nice addition as a supporting actress , because she has that charisma that seems to complete the atmosphere to any film she's in .  the funniest moments in " the muse " in my opinion were the cameos by james cameron and martin scorsese .  i mean imagine , brooks seeing these big named directors in his back yard seeking sharon stone for advice , like it was something out of the ordinary .  it was just plain hilarious .  it just adds to the satire joke , of how directors get ideas .  brilliant move by brooks .  as i mentioned before , the film is a satire much like it's proceeder bowfinger , which came out a few weeks before .  unlike bowfinger , this is not a mean spirited film that's desperate for jokes , it's rather a witty and humorous look at hollywood .   " bowfinger " had it's moments , but had quite a few problems that were never worked out , but " the muse " still managed to keep the laughs despite a bit of a detour .  by the end of the film , you're glad to see a good hearty comedy come out of it .  for once i'm not fully disappointed , because the film didn't slow down , it kept moving , even with some flaws .  thumbs up to brooks for his brave effort .  i think he'll still manage to keep his edge around well into the future . 
neg@ pos neg i know there were times during this movie that i laughed pretty hard .  the problem is , i can't remember them as i write this review .  that's not a good sign .  in booty call , jamie foxx is bunz , a character whom i can't really describe , because i don't know that much about him .  i only know that he likes to shoot dice on the sidewalk , and that he doesn't like relationships , just " booty calls " at three in the morning ( no questions , no commitment ) .  bunz has a best friend named rushon ( tommy davidson ) , who seems to be bunz's direct opposite : on the straight and narrow , and currently in a long-term commitment ( a whole seven weeks , wow ! ) .  rushon wants to finally sleep with his girlfriend , nikki ( tamala jones ) , but for a reason which is not totally explained , it's going to happen after a double date with bunz and nikki's friend lysterine ( vivica a . fox ) , who have never met .  to make a long story short , the two couples pair off and spend the rest of the evening having their attempts to do the deed spoiled by nikki's obsession with safe sex .  first she wants condoms , so bunz and rushon go out and get them .  oh , no , they have to be latex , not lambskin .  back to the store .  now they've got to get dental dams , or there'll be no foreplay .  why are both couples stopped each time nikki makes a demand ?  nikki phones lysterine , who lives across the hall , and tells her she'd better be making these demands , too .  talk about coitus interruptus .  booty call is a film that does not know whether it wants to be a regular comedy or one of those over-the-top comedies .  the difference between the two is that in the latter , things constantly happen which are so far removed from reality .  in this category , for example , you have ace ventura : private eye on the mild side , and airplane !  at the extreme .  there are times during booty call where the film steps out of its shell and tries for this status , but then too often quickly retreats to the safety of convention .  it is disappointing , and even worse , distracting .  there are also instances where the screenplay by takashi bufford and bootsie parker ( are those real names ? )  does not live up to its potential , as jokes are left unexploited or even ruined by bad writing .  for instance , there is a scene where our main characters are in a chinese restaurant .  bunz goes up to an asian gangster and speaks to him in fluent cantonese , much to everyone's surprise .  however , when asked how he learned the language , he goes into this explanation of how he started picking up words from late-night kung-fu films , and soon gained mastery .  this negated the ludicrousness of the entire scene .  if , on the other hand , when asked how he learned to speak chinese , bunz simply replied with , " kung-fu movies , " and then moved on , the joke would have been much more effective .  this is because it would have been totally unbelievable , but funny because we know it is unbelievable .  by explaining the point and trying to make the ridiculous plausible , the film is not giving its viewers enough credit .  the inconsistency and uncertain believability unfortunately also raise other questions .  why are two such disparate people like bunz and rushon best friends ?  why do rushon and nikki fix up bunz and lysterine ?  if nikki is so obsessed with safe sex , why doesn't she have some condoms at her own apartment ?  these questions are not answered by the screenplay , but are overlooked for the sole reason of moving the plot forward .  a very noticeable quality of booty call is the prevalence of unnecessary foul language .  some movies use a lot of swear words , but use them under very justifiable circumstances , as when they are employed consistent with a character's pattern of speech .  other films , such as the recent jackie brown , use them in ways that almost parody themselves .  booty call just sticks them in to get laughs , and it doesn't work .  they stick out like sore thumbs because there is almost no reason to use them .  half of the scenes seem to occur for no reason .  the chinese restaurant , a holdup at a convenience store , and a trip to the hospital seem to have nothing to do with the story , and are in there for filler .  this is surprising , considering that the film is less than eighty minutes long .  it's too bad that the core of the film isn't much better , since it is comprised of sometimes funny , but forgettable dialog .  i refer you to the first paragraph of this review . 
pos@ pos neg i must admit i'm going to be a bit biased in my review of the new romantic comedy serendipity , because that also defines how i met my current girlfriend .  the magic and mystery of our fated encounter is also embodied in the quirkiness and freshness of the very funny and very romantic serendipity .  i am not a big fan of the romantic comedy genre , but something drew me to this film .  maybe it was the casting of the underrated jeremy piven in a supporting role , and the hilarious eugene levy .  maybe it was my hope that john cusack would get the redemption he justly deserves after such crap as high fidelity , con air , and pushing tin .  but maybe it was because i feel as giddy as a school kid right now with this whole romantic thing currently in my life .  the story of serendipity is simple .  two people , john trager ( john cusack ) and sara thomas ( kate beckinsale , looking ever so hot ) , have a chance encounter over a pair of gloves -- with buck henry smack dab in the middle .  charmed beyond repair , these two knuckleheads grab a sundae together at a caf ? called serendipity , talk about that irresponsible thing called fate and the avenues it leads people down , and spend a few hours at the local ice skating rink .  but with each of them already involved with other parties , sara has john write his name and number on a $5 bill and she writes her name and number on a copy of love in the time of cholera .  sara declares that if this " thing " -- let's just call it love -- is destined to happen , fate will bring them together in the future .  years later and on opposite coasts of america , john and sara -- both engaged but still unsure whether they have found their soul mates -- decide to seek each other out to rest their doubts .  what happens then is an enjoyable and often hilarious cat-and-mouse game with the fates - involving such items as mistaken identity , a graduate homage , john corbett as a freaky new age musician , and eugene levy as an irate and crazed salesman -- to find out if that " thing " was right after all .  fortunately , first-time screenwriter marc klein has sketched strong , well-rounded , characters to propel a predictable and corny narrative .  coupled with deft directing by michael chelsom ( director of the very unfunny town and country and the very funny funny bones ) and the use of time-lapse camera work to illustrate the passage of years -- the film comes off with genuine believability and sincerity .  both piven and molly shannon make nice sidekick characters  on the flipside , films such as you've got mail , made in heaven , and even high fidelity are the quiet inspirations for the film's main journey at hand .  but it's what happens to the unexpecting characters left behind in the romantic wake after john and sara find happiness this is the most unsettling part of the picture .

"  _a_night_at_the_roxbury_ takes an already-thin concept and tediously stretches it far beyond the breaking point--and that of viewers' patience levels .  the first five minutes or so of _roxbury_ play very much like one of the original " roxbury guys " skits .  with " what is love ? "  blaring on the soundtrack , the brotherly duo of doug and steve butabi ( chris kattan and will ferrell ) bob their heads , scope out " hotties " at clubs , and then bump a select few with violent pelvic thrusts .  there is one crucial difference , however--these guys speak .  that little fact has been used as justification for the film's existence , that the butabis' newfound capacity for speech would open up a whole new set of doors for the characters .  the doors opened by director john fortenberry and screenwriters steve koren , ferrell , and kattan are new , that's for sure , but they all lead to comic dead ends .  there is no story per se , only a loosely structured and linked series of subplots .  the brothers literally run into ( or , rather , get run into , as in by car ) richard grieco of _21_jump_street_ fame , and through him they gain entrance into the exclusive roxbury club .  there , they meet a hotshot club owner ( chazz palminteri , conspicuously uncredited--can you blame him ? ) , who takes an interest in an idea of theirs .  meanwhile , the bros' overbearing father ( dan hedaya ) wants them to stop clubbing .  when doug refuses and the dimwitted steve obeys his father , a rift is created between the two .  the narrative messiness of _roxbury_ would have been forgivable if all that went on were the slightest bit funny , but virtually none of it is .  the assembled press audience mostly sat stonily silent throughout the entire film , with the one big exception being a big laugh near the end .  alas , the joke--a rather lazy takeoff on _jerry_maguire_--will only strike a chord with people who have seen that film .  granted , a lot of people _have_ seen _jerry_maguire_ , but the fact that the film's best joke is completely dependent on one's familiarity with another film says a lot about _roxbury_'s lack of inspiration .  that lack of inspiration can be traced back to the insipid characters themselves .  like too many of the skits on the current incarnation of _saturday_night_live_ , " the roxbury guys " is a one-joke sketch that never once suggests that the characters have enough comic life in them to survive outside of the sketch context .  after watching one of the " roxbury " skits on snl , this is what you come away with from the characters : they bob their heads to " what is love ? " ,  bump unsuspecting women , and . . . that's all .  after watching _a_night_at_the_roxbury_ , you'll be left with exactly the same . 
pos@ pos neg anyone who saw alan rickman's finely-realized performances in truly madly deeply and sense and sensibility will be unsurprised that the actor-turned-director is a bit of a poet at heart .  however , for those who recall him only as the maniacal villain of die hard and robin hood : prince of thieves , this recognition may be something of a shock .  nevertheless , " poetic " is an excellent term to describe rickman's feature debut as a director , the winter guest .  the film has a simple , unhurried rhythm that uses all of the available elements to fashion a successful whole .  the result is an occasionally haunting , sometimes magical , and always insightful human drama .  the winter guest isn't about resolving plot threads and advancing a story line ; it's about exploring relationships and examining life in all of its stages .  the winter guest does not tell a traditional tale , nor does it ascribe to a conventional narrative structure ? there is no real beginning or end .  instead , we are given an opportunity to observe one day in the lives of eight humans .  they represent both sexes , multiple generations , and a variety of relationships ? male and female ; young , middle-aged , and elderly ; friends , would-be lovers , and kin .  we see expectations fulfilled and disappointed , emotional boundaries eroded , and truths unveiled .  there is comedy and tragedy .  most importantly , much of what transpires during the course of the winter guest will find an echo in our own lives ? in this fiction can be found much truth .  the setting is small town in scotland on the coldest day of the year .  it's so frigid that the sea has begun to freeze over .  the onshore wind cuts like a knife and snow blankets the beach , giving the terrain an alien appearance .  it is against this backdrop that the relationships of the film are captured .  there are four pairings , and , although there is some interaction between the different twosomes , the winter guest's focus is on the dynamics internal to each relationship .  the first , meatiest pairing is that of elspeth ( phylida law ) and her recently-widowed daughter , frances ( emma thompson ) .  these two have a stormy relationship .  they love each other deeply , but both are stubborn and willful , and neither is willing to admit that they need the other .  much of their interaction is argumentative , but , during the course of a long walk to the frozen shoreline , they come to an unspoken understanding of how much each means to the other .  frances' adult son , alex ( gary hollywood ) , is a lonely young man who has been caring for his mother since the death of his father .  on this day , he meets a girl , nita ( arlene cockburn ) , who has secretly been spying on him for weeks .  although their first encounter is antagonistic ( she throws a snowball at him ) , both quickly become aware of an undeniable attraction .  once they retire to a place where they can be alone , however , things don't go exactly as planned .  lily ( sheila reid ) and chloe ( sandra voe ) are a couple of old friends who are frequent funeral attendees .  death is a topic of endless fascination for them , perhaps because they are so close to it , and they spend their spare time scanning the obituaries , looking for the next funeral or cremation in the area .  it doesn't matter whether or not they knew the deceased .  it's the ceremony that they're interested in .  sam ( douglas murphy ) and tom ( sean biggerstaff ) , a pair of schoolboy chums , are spending this cold february day cutting classes and hanging out at the beach , horsing around , building a small fire for warmth , and walking on the frozen water .  unlike lily and chloe , these two have their entire lives ahead of them .  they are young enough to still believe in magic , but old enough to recognize that the process of crossing into adulthood robs life of the simple joy that only children can experience .  the acting is strong and believable .  the mixture of veteran performers and first-timers is effective , with the most successful choice being the casting of real-life mother and daughter phylida law and emma thompson in the most prominent roles .  there is a chemistry in their interaction that would be hard to replicate with two different , non-related actors .  and , of course , the physical resemblance makes it that much easier to accept elspeth and frances as parent and child .  the winter guest began its life as a stage play in 1995 , with rickman as the director .  four of the film's principals , phylida law , arlene cockburn , sheila reid , and sandra voe , appeared in the theatrical version before moving to the film .  unlike several recent motion pictures adapted from plays , the winter guest has been successfully opened up .  the rough , bleak scottish countryside becomes as much of a character as any of the eight humans .  in fact , considering how important the climate is to every relationship under rickman's microscope , it could be argued that this is the single most important element of the movie .  if you appreciate character studies , the winter guest is a solid effort with enough power to stay with you after you have left the theater . 
neg@ pos neg man , this was one wierd movie .  similar to conspiracy theory in that it couldn't decide which genre it is .  the first hour is your standard stock aliens clone , which nicely created an eerie atmosphere about the ship .  the last half hour ?  this was when the makers blew the script out the airlock and just decided - " screw it , let's just kill everybody " .  from then on - forget sci-fi . . . this  movie becomes 100% horror .  what really dissappointed me about this movie was that it tried to scare you in entirely the wrong way .  instead of using clever tricks or trying to build up to a scare - this movie just uses loud noises , sudden camera shifts and short quick bursts of gore . . . . . yawn . . . . everyone's  seen it all before and knows when to expect it .  the one thing that was done well was the lead up to finding out about what happened to the previous crew .  there are skeletons lying around mangled and mashed , but what did this ?  then finally after being painfully restored - the new crew views the video .  the acting isn't too bad at all . . . . . considering what the actors had to work with anyway , as there is no complex or interesting dialogue to speak of .  there was some very nice camerawork in certain sequences though , like when the hull near the bridge of the event horizon is breached and the camera pans back to follow specific objects as they bounce across the deck and are sucked out into space .  this movie could have been so much better .  it had a good experienced cast who deserved more to work with .  there was just nothing new here that any of us haven't seen before in aliens or hellraiser . 
pos@ pos neg [note : after claiming otherwise , my appetite was indeed whetted by kenneth branagh's hamlet to search out other attempts to translate shakespeare to film in hopes of finding a better mousetrap .  as it happens , it didn't take long . ]  is there a more romantic director than franco zeffirelli ?  known mainly to american audiences as the man behind 1968's romeo and juliet ( required viewing for many high schoolers , and as much as most ever learn of shakespeare ) , he is also a favorite at the metropolitan opera , where his achingly beautiful designs further the already lush emotion of many a puccini aria .  last year he gave us his beautifully realized version of jane eyre , one of the twin peaks ( with wuthering heights ) of romantic literature .  it might seem peculiar , then , that zeffirelli ever had an interest in translating hamlet for the screen .  at first blush , hamlet is far removed from romance .  the hero , though a prince , is depressed , conflicted and confused .  the ostensible love interest gets little screen time , and her scenes with her prince are usually as an object of mockery .  the plot is full of political intrigue and the players are as cursed as the house of atreus .  it is zeffirelli's genius , however , that he is able to expose the romantic core of hamlet and give the sometimes dry tale an emotional embrace .  in this italian master's hands , romance is everywhere -- in a son's worship of his father , in the bonds of deepest friendship , in the private thoughts of young lovers , even in the mystery of castles by the sea .  after all , the story hinges on a ghost , and what could be more romantic than that ?  what seemed like a cheap way to sell tickets at the time turned out to be one of the most romantic gestures of all , namely , hiring then-reigning hollywood hunk mel gibson to play the lead .  who could believe that the man who made his mark playing mad max and a " lethal weapon " ( in the series of the same name ) would have the skill to succeed in the most famous role in the english language ?  franco zeffirelli , that's who .  and it is apparent in every frame that his instinct was right on the money .  what gibson brings to the role is a naturalness and ease which makes the whole story meaningful , not to mention comprehensible .  his line readings sound spontaneous rather than rehearsed .  his movements and gestures ( excepting his sometimes too active eyes ) are totally in keeping with the character .  this is a hamlet whose pain we feel , whose struggle we empathize with , and whose death we mourn as sincerely as horatio at film's end .  glenn close , the other big name in the production , also does well by the script and satisfies as hamlet's mother , gertrude -- though i must confess i'm still trying to understand the character as written .   ( zeffirelli's incestuous interpretation of hamlet's relationship with his mother doesn't help . )  alan bates makes a believably evil claudius without resorting to the mannerisms of a hollywood heavy .  by and large the rest of the cast performs admirably and comfortably .  of special note are the cinematography by david watkin and the score by ennio morricone .  both support the realistic mood marvelously ( as do the sets and costumes ) , without any overstated effects that declare " this is important ; this is shakespeare ! "  i particularly appreciate that the words are often spoken without any music at all : the melody of a wonderfully wrought phrase is given its due .  perhaps it is difficult to call edited shakespeare " definitive . "  and there are certainly quite a few other filmed versions of hamlet that i have not seen .  but if you've ever felt the urge to overcome your fear of the bard , this hamlet is an excellent place to start . 
neg@ pos neg when respecting a director , you must also respect the fact that they are not perfect .  woody allen has made a couple less-than good films , and he's my favorite .  even martin scorsese hasn't had a perfect track record .  kevin smith , after a smashing debut with the classic " clerks " stooped as low to sell-out and make the dreadful " mallrats . "  i mean , so far the only director who's made several films , none of which have been bad is richard linklater ( " slacker , " " dazed and confused , " " before sunrise , " and " suburbia " . . . all  which were great ) .  now , i adore quentin tarantino .  his first two films were classic films , the second one being one of the greatest films of all time .  but 1995 just wasn't that good of a year for him .  he made way too many tv appearances .  he mispronounced jackie chan's name on the mtv movie awards .  and he made this film .   ( he was also awarded an oscar , so i guess that would be a grand exception ) .  robert rodriguez is also a great director ; not a brilliant one , but a cool one .  i've never seen an alexandre rockwell or allison anders film , so i can't comment on them .  but in this crap ensemble director's film , all four give pitiful efforts .  pitiful for any director , too .  now in all fairness , ensemble director pieces never really work out .  i've never seen all of " new york stories , " but have heard the first two films , by scorsese and francis ford coppola are crap ( i saw woody's one , which was hilarious but not totally up to par ) . but i will rate each film individually and then report back to you on the overal average score of the film .  exposition : a simple one - a bellhop , ted ( the totally overdone tim roth , who's a god and all , but not in this one , though he has a couple good moments ) is working on new year's eve for his first shift ( ! ! ! ) in an old fancy hotel .  he's the only one there ( again : ! ! ! ) and he only has a couple rooms ( yet again : ! ! ! ) .  the old bellhop ( the seemingly immortal marc lawrence - who hated pulp fiction actually ) hands over his cap to ted and he goes to his job happily .  as the night goes on , he becomes increasingly annoyed and hostile .  yea .   ( the short films are presented in order , btw ) :  the missing ingredient writer/director : allison anders starring : sammi davis , amanda decadenet , valeria golino , madonna , ione skye , lili taylor , alicia witt  this one starts it off horribly with no plot , no intrigue , and crap dialogue .  the situation is so terrible that it's physically painful to watch .  the plot has something to do with a coven of witches needing sperm to bring back a godess who is ( gasp ! )  stuck inside some object in their hotel room .  the witch that was supposed to bring it ( ione skye ) calls up ted and asks him if she can perform fellatio on him to get it .  yeah , that's what i said .  stupid plot , inane characters who aren't interesting at all , etc , etc , etc . the only good thing about this is it has a good cast which , in turn , it wastes pitifully .  not even actually funny for a second .  my rating ( out of 5 ) : no stars ! ! ! !  the wrong man writer/director : alexandre rockwell starring : david proval , jennifer beals and laurence bender  another bad little film with another stupid sex thing going on .  ted stumbles into the wrong room or something and gets in the middle of a couple ( david proval and jennifer beals in her attempt at " coming back " ) who are playing sex games .  ted tries to escape and we cheer him on so it will end soon .  but at least this has a bit of comedy in it , just not that much .  and david proval has never overacted as much .  and it's " pulp fiction " producer laurence bender who gets to puke from a window .  a masterpiece compared to the first one , but still . . .  the misbehavers writer/director : robert rodriguez starring : antonio banderes , tamlyn tomita , lana mckissack , danny verduzco , salma hayek  would a robert rodriguez film be the same without salma hayek's navel ?  nope .  luckily she's on the tv dancing so we get to see her .  surprisingly enough , when i read the screenplay ( about a year before actually seeing it ) , this one seemed to have the most potential .  it was fast-paced , funny , and well , funny .  but when i watched it , it seemed anti-climactic and only seemed to gain any momentum towards the end when everything happened at once .  antonio overacts nicely and the two kids ( lana and danny ) are funny .  but , as i said , it moves slowly and in that way , it's more painful than funny .  but the ending was stupid and funny at the same time .  oh !  the plot : antonio is a supposed gangster ( assumed , really ) who leaves his two troubling kids home while he and his wife ( tomita ) go out to get drunk at a new year's party .  antonio hires ted for a couple bucks to watch his kids all night long , but things go wrong . . . it  was okay .  the man from hollywood writer/director : quentin tarantino starring : quentin tarantino , bruce willis , paul calderon and jennifer beals ( again )  ironically , this one could be considered the best for a bad reason : it best represents what quentin has done with this film .  he plays chester , a spoiled brat actor or something who has just had a huge box-office hit on his hands and is living it up by playing an anti-climactic game from a hitchcock tv episode starring steve mcqueen and peter lorre where they gamble to see if one of them can get light from his lighter ten times in a row .  they're drunk and need sober but nervous ted to hold the cleaver and bring it down if the lighter doesn't light .  they also pay him a lot of cash .  this is so much exactly what this little film is about that it's campy .  tim roth was probably payed a lot of money to do this stupid part in this stupid film made by a bunch of people who are high on themselves 'cause they've had hits , major or minor .  it took quentin to realize that .  but the thing is , it doesn't seem like he realizes that .  if he did , i'd give this a good 3 stars .  but this sucked .  it was anti-climactic and the dialogue wasn't very good .  he starts off with a very long steadicam shot then goes to flashes .  that makes no sense .  it's cool for a while , then he makes it uneven .  it's long and it's just not very good .  hopefully quentin never repeats what he did with this one .  conclusion : what's the moral here ?  if you've made celebrated films , don't do an ensemble piece .  they should have re-watched " new york stories " and then stopped in their tracks .  none of these have any point to them and they're embarrassing to not only the writer/directors , but to the actors 'cause they're working with crap .  but i will forgive everyone involved and i especially look forward to quentin's next directing job ( even though he and rodriguez jumped back to the top immeadiately with the cool " from dusk till dawn , " which i found exhilerating ) .  i love quentin and i suppose it's good he made " the man from hollywood " because it makes him seem more realistic and not some " god of cinema . "  i seem to respect directors if they aren't " gods " and are actually human beings who make mistakes .   " the man from hollywood " is his big mistake and let's hope he doesn't return her continuously . 
pos@ pos neg copyright 1996 graeme huggan carry on henry is all about henry viii and his eight wives !  sid james plays henry , who no sooner has the film started , is getting rid of his present queen and hopes to find another one soon .  as part of his alliance with france , he requests the hand-in-marriage to the queen of normandy ( joan sims ) .  she comes to england in the hope of marrying henry but when he finds out that she loves garlic and has a reeking garlic breath , he is totally averse to the idea of marriage .  henry's court is very corrupt , with the cardinal ( terry scott ) trying to bribe cromwell ( kenneth williams ) and cromwell trying to bribe the king .  there is a state of crisis when the king puts marie the queen ( sims ) in the tower of london ready for execution .  the queen is pregnant but she has not liased with the king before , so fingers are pointed at sir roger de lodgerley played by charles hawtrey , who has a rather lecherous character to play this time .  the cardinal and cromwell decide to get a signed confession from sir roger by using all kinds of torture devices !  owing to circumstances , sir roger is sometimes needed to sign that he is the father and sometimes that he isn't .  this is because of renewed threats by the king of france ( peter gilmore ) to come over himself , which in the end he does .  by then , henry has found himself a new queen , played by none other than barbara windsor !  it looks like he has some explaining to do !  there are stand-out performances by sid james as henry , joan sims as marie , and terry scott in an unusual role as the cardinal .  also there are cameos from kenneth connor and peter butterworth , who plays barbara's father .  the set and costume design is first class and the overall production of this film is good .  there is even an early appearance from david prowse , who later became the green cross code man and darth vader .  the film does have it's downsides though , as it is getting pretty routine for the carry-on team to stage historical films and the inventive streak of the script seems to run out pretty quickly .  there is also the absence of hattie jacques and bernard bresslaw , who could have helped the film along .  however , overall the film is funny and there are plenty of laughs and saucy jokes , so that is why i mainly recommend it to carry on fans only , but there is enough humour in the film to make it worth anyone's while to sit down and watch it . 
neg@ pos neg this review contains spoilers , but believe me , i don't say anything you can't guess 10 minutes into the movie .  i * did * go into this one with high expectations .  i had been exposed to media reports that this film would signify a departure from the slasher flicks .  i sort of expected another exorcist or the shining .  i even put aside my general rule of not seeing this type of film .  boy , was i wrong !  another garbage slasher flick , the only difference being that * this * one has a story !  the story , you ask ?  well , a scumball buys a chinese puzzle from a guy in an arab souk .  he takes it home , somehow getting it past customs : - ) and starts fiddling with it in his attic .  lo and behold , after he takes it apart , three demons appear and start taking him apart , but with meat hooks .  when they're finished , his gizzards are hanging from the ceiling .  they botch up their cleanup job , however , and manage to leave his heart ( or some gland ; i didn't really recognize the organ ) under a floorboard .  the guy's brother and his brother's wife appear at the door soon after , and decide to move in .  they throw away scumball's belongings , and set up house .  turns out that wife is a bit of a nympho , and screwed around with scumball right before her marriage .  she starts having some wild hallucinations .  later , hubby spills some blood on the attic floorboards ( slow-mo special effects of the buckets of blood hitting the ground--all from the tiny cut on his hand ) .  said blood is eagerly sucked up by scumball's organ .  the organ grows into a thing that requires yet more blood in order to complete the regeneration into a really ugly thing .  it establishes mind contact with wife , who agrees to help him get more blood , because she really wants to be screwed again .  so , she helps him kill three businessmen .  scumball , at this time , gradually gets his strength back and grows all his organs back .  problem is , he doesn't have any skin , and even after three or four corpses , still doesn't get any skin .  he finally gets some , though , but strangely enough , he ends up looking like his brother .  guess they couldn't get the original actor back .  who knows .  scumball ( whose name is frank ) is not a nice guy .  he describes his torture by the demons fondly , as the " ultimate pleasure and pain , since at that level there is no difference between the two . "  somehow , i don't see getting torn apart by 90 fish- and meat-hooks a lot of fun .  this guy is * so * bad ( " how bad * is * he ? " ) ,   * so * bad that the * rats * cower in a corner in fear .  for good reason , too ; he crucifies two of them for fun , and carves a third while the nympho's horsing around with hubby .  anyway . hubby's daughter ( who , if course , is not * wife's * daughter ) starts to suspect something is wrong after she sees wife going into the attic with one of her johns and the ensuing screams .  the dumb bimbo meets scumball , and is not impressed .  she manages to escape with the chinese puzzle , and brings out the demons .  at any rate , the demons are pissed off that they screwed up their cleanup ; they're normally quite meticulous about that type of thing .  the story boils down to the demons trying to correct their mistake .  the demons are not , however , the good guys .  the dumb bimbo's the good guy .  she somehow not only gets them to take care of frank , but also banishes them to hell or oblivion , we're not too sure which .  not too shabby for someone with single-digit iq .  this is basically a " bad jinn " story .  it is an * awful * movie .  awful acting , bad focus in the photography , many scenes of skin being penetrated by meathooks , which is really unrealistic , and looks like the latex that it is .  continuity ?  who cares .  acting ?   * terrible * .  script ?  horrible .  sounds canned .  unrealistic .  story is so-so , but the impact is lost long , long before the film ends .  i do think the * rat * acting was quite good .  i have never seen rats look afraid .  they should get nominated for an award .  really good acting there , the best in the movie .   " the envelope for best furry rodent , please . . . "  a " " rating would be far too generous .  a " 1/10 " rating ( or -4 in the -4 to +4 rating system ) is far more accurate .  this movie is so bad that people in the audience were laughing , chortling at the bad acting and crummy dialog .  i can see this film turning into the next rocky horror picture show .  people were getting so fed up they were yelling warnings up to the characters on the screen .  had to have something to do .  dumb , dumb , dumb movie .  i was embarrassed that i spent money to see it .  it goes without saying that i disagree with the other reviews on the board that attempt to review the film for itself .  lots of slime and red-dyed corn syrup does not constitute " horror , " in my opinion . 
pos@ pos neg david mamet has long been my favorite screenwriter and director .  with his distinctive , more often than not ingenious dialogue , and his laid back style of direction nearly all of his movies are absolutely irresistible .  some of them tend to be thickly layered , deceptive productions that require the audience to look at the film in a less superficial manner than the plot seems to require in order to discern its concealed message , or sometimes even a concealed storyline .  and although the real plot in his new project the winslow boy is slightly more conspicuous than in some of his other endeavors , it is still a brilliantly complex , consistently riveting motion picture about honor , about sacrifice , and about the difference between what is commonly known as justice and what is right .  oh , and it's rated g .  incidentally , this is the first time that mamet has decided to adapt someone else's work ; namely a play by terrence rattigan , set in the 19th century .  he casts nigel hawthorne in the lead role as arthur winslow , a rich , aging man who finds out that his 14 year old son ronnie has been kicked out of the naval academy for allegedly stealing a 5 shilling postal note .   " did you do it ? " he asks his boy .   " no father , i didn't , " ronnie answers .  that's enough for arthur , who , with his oldest daughter ( rebecca pidgeon ) , immediately starts a crusade to bring his son's case to court .  they enlist the help of sir robert morton , a notorious attorney to help them achieve that formidably daunting task .  it all seems fairly frivolous , and no matter how you look at it , the winslow case is not the trial of the century .  but arthur is determined to keep his family's word clean and he is willing to go quite far to make sure of that .  soon enough , sir robert morton along with the rest of the country becomes equally wrapped up in the proceedings .  so do we .  all david mamet does for the script is tighten and hone the dialogue , but his style is still fairly apparent .  the characters still talk in his trademark staccatto lines and there is still tension present in conversations that no ordinary writer would be able to make tense .  but this is not mamet's norm , and it's refreshing to see mamet deviate from his world of crooks , gangsters as con men , wonderful as those films were .  nigel hawthorne's performance is nearly flawless .  his delivery is that of a dignified yet not pompous man who seems to be getting beaten at his own game .  we pity the man , but we also like him .  rebecca pidgeon , david mamet's wife , who gave a fairly awful performance in the spanish prisoner is at the top of her game here as arthur's oldest daughter , a flailing feminist who gives her all to the winslow case as a way for making up for her lack of success in the women's suffrage movement .  the winslow boy is a wonderful movie that avoids cliches such as a seemingly inevitable courtroom scene and shoots higher -- it wants to make a real impact rather than a phony one .  be honest : did you feel anything profound at or after the courtroom scenes in films like a time to kill ?  if you wanted to but didn't , this is a movie for you .  it is the epitome of subtlety : it's powerful without being too emotional , sad without even trying to be depressing .  david mamet can churn out some great scripts , but in this movie he proves to those who ever doubted it once and for all that he is a hell of a director too .  he is almost a national treasure .  his films deserve their own genre .   ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ; 
neg@ pos neg this well-conceived but ultra sugary coming-of-age film is not for everyone , and i include myself as one of those who found it too sappy for my digestion .  joseph cross ( joshua beal ) is a 10-year-old who is saddened by the recent loss of his grandfather ( loggia ) to bone marrow cancer .  loggia is wonderful in relating to the child in such a wholesome manner , it almost saves this film from drowning in syrup .  the beals are like a sitcom idyllic family , where everyone is just so nice and affluent , and properly religious without being fanatical .  the beals , the father ( denis leary ) and his wife ( dana delany ) , are both successful doctors ; julia stiles plays joshua's older sister , needling her younger brother but also showing that she really cares about him .  this is a family seemingly conceived in heaven , but living in south philadelphia , sending their children to a well-run catholic school .  joshua , the protagonist and the narrator of this yarn , is a handsome , sweet , intelligent , friendly , and endearing child , who does well in school , relates to the nuns and priests , and talks politely to his well-meaning parents .  all this mawkish interplay makes it almost too nauseating to watch .  the plot arises when joseph has a problem coping with the death of his beloved grandfather , who promised to be with him forever .  his answer is to search for god , pretty heady stuff for a youngster his age to do , but that's just the way it is , sometimes .  this search for god takes us nowhere because , as his friend david ( reifsnyder ) says , where can you look for him if he doesn't exist .  now , that's a smart kid .  but joseph looks for him in the usual places , and what better place than to start in the parochial school he attends .  one of his teachers is the kind-hearted sister terry ( rosie o'donnell ) , who wears a philly baseball hat and equates the jesus stories with baseball , making him the clean-up hitter , and in my opinion , if she wasn't a big tv star , would have a vocation as a parochial school teacher , she is that convincing .  throughout the film , she is saved from answering any tough ( sic ! )  question about god by the bell , as it rings to end the class .  nothing much happens in the search for god , there is no parody of the catholic school ; though a visiting cardinal is found by the boy not to be able to talk to god , but this is gentle stuff , no real criticism or search for god is attempted .  what comes next into play is some hollywood hokum , which is designed not to upset anyone , as joseph has a reassuring encounter with a real , live angel , a blond little boy his own age and dressed like him in the catholic school uniform who wears the innocuous smile of a goody-goody .  the film ends as this angel ( ! ! ! )  tells him his grandfather is all right .  his quest is ended , as apparently angels don't have wings and are approachable ; and god , well , . . .  maybe that's for another film down the road .  this part of the film was the final straw for me , i couldn't swallow any more goo .  as this film flopped commercially , his next one , the sixth sense , pared down the schmaltz and came up smelling like a rose .  though if you look through the cleverness of both scripts , this director is loaded with hokum , all he has learned how to do , is hide the hokum better .  well , god bless him , if he can do that .  this is a nice family picture and there is room for it in hollywood .  it's just too bad that it had nothing relevent or even truthful to say about death , children in a parochial elementary school , or for that matter , about god .  and that family of his , they're too good for words .  yet the film meant well and its benign message had its heart in the right place .  for those who want to see something soft , without a bite to it , this is the one . 
pos@ pos neg in arguably the most anticipated movie this century , george lucas has achieved a very mixed reaction to a sure blockbuster .  despite the fact the script and plot is a bit of a let down , the entire movie on the whole can be considered a milestone in technical excellence , in the sound and special effects department .  in terms of characters , by far the most outstanding and interesting is queen amidala ( natalie portman ) , whose mature performance far exceeds her tender 14 years of age .  she is one ? hot' babe who defines true ? woman leadership' .  she not only has a presence , but knows how to take command of the situation and save her planet from ruination .  no thanks to the jedi knights who although led by the force , lack leadership qualities in terms of thinking up a plan to do anything .  the young obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) who has a bad hair day in every scene , gets to kill a bad guy in the end , but lacks a love interest to make him a desirable sort of hero .  in fact all the jedi knight are a bit asexual - there must be something about the force which makes them all hermits and loners .  i mean it would be interesting to see yoda's girlfriend for a change , if he has one .  not much better is qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) who mostly broods , and has a better hair do than obi-wan , but only to find the young anakin skywalker and make the biggest mistake of his life .  also fascinating is george lucas ? metoclorian' theory , which claims that micro-organisms live within our cells and tie us to the fabric of the universe .  and it is the high concentrations of these organisms in an individual which make them particularly powerful in the force .  more humerous are the claims to the immaculate conception of darth vader , no doubt a concept stolen from the christian faith , except there will be no christmas to celebrate the birth of this dark emissary of the force .  overall an experience which is not to be missed because of the very fact that it's predecessor almost command a viewing of this inferior successor .  by all means not the pinnacle of the star wars phenomena but an adequate addition to the clan .  watch out for the next one , it should be one steamy encounter between queen amidala and anakin skywalker - who i believe should be portrayed by ? leonardo di caprio . 
neg@ pos neg are you like me ?  do you get annoyed seeing people talk on their cellulars in public places , shouting out loud , not giving a ratt's ass about anyone around them , and basically just wallowing in their own self-importance ?  well if you are , than you will most likely agree with my rating of this film since it basically features a trio of annoying ladies bickering away on the phone for an hour and a half . . . only to make up and hug in the end .  aaaaaaaahhhh . . .  plot : three grown-up sisters living their own separate lives , begin to re-establish their communication lines when their dear old dad falls ill .  critique : this would be a good movie if it wasn't for the fact that it's got very little to say , features uncaring people sharing annoying phone conversations , is chockfull of bad acting moments and provides less emotional satisfaction than any third-rate after-school special .  and i'm being nice !  how junk like this gets made is beyond me , but happy am i that the ephron sisters will finally be dealt a professional blow , considering the regurgitation level of their material had just about reached its limit .  the only true emotional moment demonstrated between meg ryan's character and her dad in this film is when he hugs her and swings her around at a christmas tree lot .  wow . . . how  deep .  of course , the same christmas tune that's played in every ephron flick chimes out in the background , while characters continue to build " bonds " among one another by making reference to old , quaint movies or movie stars .  stop me . . . i'm  gonna cry again !  this film is a mess .  the characters are boring and irritating to watch , the plot has something to do with three selfish sisters talking on the phone a whole lot , kind of liking their father ( but not really ) and then finally realizing the error of their ways , while sharing an " emotional " moment about movie stars from the 50s .  admittedly , i was not expecting much from a film whose television trailer features meg ryan screaming every two seconds and a big dog rolling its eyes , but even i was surprised at the level of ineptitude when it came to some of the acting efforts put forth in this film .  meg did fine as the sister who cries a lot , looking as adorable as ever , but someone please put lisa kudrow inside a permanent home of limited range , cause this woman basically is that very same character that she plays in every single movie/tv show that she's in .  enough already !  and diane keaton must've spent more time thinking about her role behind the camera in this one , cause her acting was amateurish at best .  neither one convinced in " emotional " scenes .  granted , they gave walter matthau the best lines in the film and that's probably where my rating of three points comes from .  all in all , this movie is not funny ( unless you're one to chuckle at train wrecks ) , provides zero drama ( unless you consider loud phone conversations moving ) , generates absolutely no emotion ( although i did tear up when meg hugged a coffee machine ) and ends on a perfectly pretentious note ( " oh no , please don't get any flour on my donna karan dress ! ) .  ugh .  i suggest that all ladies take their husbands/boyfriends to see this movie if they are pissed off at them about something !  that'll teach 'em to mess with you !  oh and incidentally , mrs . joblo also likened this movie to a piece of cow dung flailing in the wind , so there !  then again . . . maybe  you'll like it .   : ) 
pos@ pos neg the party is one of those classic slapstick comedies that will leave you , at times , cracking up .  the film takes place , for the most part , in real-time during an exclusive evening party that is attended only by the biggest names in hollywood .  hrundi v . bakshi , played very well by peter sellers , is a struggling actor who just came to america from his homeland , india .  hrundi tries out his acting talents , but it seems that he just isn't cut out for the job .  on the set of his current film that he stars in , hrundi seems to make everything go for the worse .  during the filming of this movie set in the 1800's , hrundi manages to annoy the director ( herbert ellis ) in any way he can .  this includes a pitiful acting job in many scenes , wearing an underwater watch in one scene , and accidentally detonating a massive set .  many of the hollywood producers and big names want hrundi out of the business forever .  and when the director makes a personal phone call to mr . clutterbuck ( j .  edward mckinley ) pleading for hrundi's ejection from hollywood , everything is pretty much over for hrundi .  clutterbuck writes his name down on a piece of paper to insure that hrundi will never again work in hollywood .  but when this piece of paper turns out to be the guest list for clutterbuck's exclusive party , hrundi is invited , and certain chaos is bound to occur .  of course , as predicted , hrundi causes lots of trouble .  each scene in which hrundi encounters a situation , usually one that he can't handle , is almost always very humorous .  and each scene with hrundi and the drunken waiter , who is alone hilarious , adds to the comedy in a great way .  the party can be compared to many other films of it's type , specifically the trio of naked gun movies and the airplane movies , but the party is a delightful movie that incorporates very well played out comedy into believable situations .  it also includes a number of memorable scenes ( can anyone say " birdy num-num " ? ) .  if you're in the mood for fun and enjoyable slapstick comedy , check out the party .  it's not going to be one of your all-time favorites , but if you enjoy this type of humor , you'll enjoy the party . 
neg@ pos neg phew , what a mess !  for his fifth collaboration with director rich- ard donner ( lethal weapon i-iii , maverick ) , mel gibson plays a motormouth , maybe mentally ill new york city cabbie , jerry , whose wild conspiracy theories are all but ignored by alice ( julia roberts , acting all serious ) , the justice department employee that he has a crush on .  she not interested , but another person is : a cia psychiatrist ( patrick stewart ) who promptly kidnaps him .  is one of jerry's conjectures correct ?   * is * the metal strip in the new $100 bill being used to track your movements ?  is oliver stone still alive , because he cut a deal with george bush to spread * dis * information ?  is this movie really about * any * of the crazed cabbie's theories ?  no , no , and no .  as it turns out , there's some other nonsense going on here , involving and revolving around jerry's background .   ( hint : pay attention to an early scene where jerry blacks out and flashes back , in quick succession , to images of an interrogation room , hypodermic needles , and ms . roberts herself . )  the * initial * premise is pretty good and is played , for a while , at a delightfully dizzying clip .  mel is wider-open that we've ever seen him and , if his character's relationship with roberts' initially strains credibility , their combined star power is blissfully intoxicating .   ( the highest wattage of the summer , perhaps ? )  even when the plot contrivances begin to intrude , the two remain a randy dandy screen pair .  there's a great scene in jerry's fortress , er , apartment , with alice trying to act casual as her hyperactive host tries to remember the combination to a locked coffee bean container .   ( which he stores in another locked con- tainer , his fridge . )  other hilarious moments , of which there are many , include a trio of memorable convention-breakers , where alice ditches a tail , jerry cold-cocks someone , and , later , eludes a foot pursuit , each in a uproariously unexpected fashion .

pos@ pos neg this summer , one of the most racially charged novels in john grisham's series , a time to kill , was made into a major motion picture .  on january 3 of this year , director rob reiner basically re-released the film under the title of ghosts of mississippi .  based on the true story of 1963 civil rights leader medgar evars' assassination , ghosts of mississippi revolves around the 25-year legal battle faced by myrlie evars ( whoopi goldberg , sister act ) and her quest to have her husband's obvious assassin and racist byron de la beckwith ( james woods , casino ) jailed .  so she turns to assistant district attorney and prosecutor bobby delaughter ( alec baldwin , heaven's prisoners ) to imprison the former kkk member .  ghosts sets its tone with an opening montage of images from african-american history , from slave-ship miseries to life in the racist south of the 1960's .  but all too soon , the white folks take over , intoning lines like " what's america got to do with anything ?  this is mississippi ! "  as beckwith , james woods , with his head larded with latex most of the time as an old man , teeters between portraying evil and its character .  meanwhile , goldberg turns in a very serious and weepy performance as the wife who wouldn't let her husband's death rest until she got the conviction .  both deserve serious oscar-consideration .  this brings us to the dull performance of baldwin .  let's face it , trying to match matthew mcconaughey's wonderful acting in a time to kill is basically impossible .  and baldwin is living proof of this , as no emotions could be felt .  it seemed as if he actually had to struggle to shed a single tear .  either poor acting or poor directing , but something definitely went wrong .  another strange mishap was the fact that goldberg's facial features didn't change , as she looked the same in the courtroom as she did holding her husband's dead body 25-years earlier .  yet woods' was plastered with enough make up to make him look like goldberg's father .  at least the make-up was realistic .  with some emotional moments in the poorly written script , ghosts of mississippi lacked in heart , when its predecessor , a time to kill , brought tears to everyone's eyes .  don't get me wrong , the movie wasn't all that bad , but if you've seen grisham's masterpiece , then don't expect this one to be an excellent film .   , 
neg@ pos neg susan granger's review of " american outlaws " ( warner bros . )  thomas edison's " the great train robbery " ( 1903 ) was the first western ever made and " jesse james under the black flag " ( 1923 ) first introduced the outlaw folk hero .  now , more than 20 similarly-themed pictures later , jesse james and his notorious gang of outlaws ride again in a banal mtv spin on an american legend .  the story begins as jesse ( charasmatic colin farrell ) and his brother frank ( gabriel macht ) , cole and scott younger ( scott caan , will mccormack ) and trusty comanche tom ( nathaniel arcand ) , after four years of fighting for the rebs in the civil war , return to liberty , missouri - only to discover union troops are occupying their hometown .  and an avaricious east coast railroad baron , thaddeus rains ( harris yulin ) , is forcing farmers to sell their land at less than true value , aided by allan pinkerton ( timothy dalton ) and his infamous detectives who , back then , were just thugs who provided security .  but when ma james ( kathy bates ) becomes one of their victims , jesse and the rest of the guys ( gregory smith , ty o'neal , joe stevens ) form the james-younger gang to wreak revenge by attacking the railroad's supply lines , sabotaging track and robbing the banks where the payroll is kept .  plus there's romance - between jesse and a spunky hometown gal , lee mimms ( ali larter ) .  working from a politically-correct , clich ? -drenched , sanitized and revisionist screenplay by roderick taylor and john rodgers , director les mayfield keeps the action fast-paced and goes for lightweight laughs when he can .  the choppy editing hurts but russell boyd's cinematography , luke reichle's designer duds and trevor rabin's music lend authenticity .  on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " american outlaws " is a galloping , formulaic 3 .  it's the wild west re-visited as a date movie . 
pos@ pos neg razor blade smile running as part of the vancouver international film festival played october 2nd and 4th , 1998 .  official release : halloween  reviewed by vince yim  `you think you know all about vampires . . . believe  me . . . you  know f * ck all . '  with these words , we are brought into the world of a sultry vampire seductress by the name of lilith silver ( played by eileen daly ) .  made into an immortal a century and a half ago by the sinister ethan blake , she continues to alleviate boredom with her state of being .  so , what's an undead girl to do , except squeeze into the tightest fitting clothes possible , get out her guns , seduce a few guys , and kill a few people for money and blood ?  with that out of the way , let me say this .  this film is bad .  this film is really , really bad .  yet somehow , it is strangely enjoyable .  with all the elements of a direct to video horror flick ? buxom babes , gore , cheesy dialogue , and bad acting ? any casual film viewer would be more inclined to spend their money on renting innocent blood or going to see blade .  still , it is considered to be one of the finest british vampire film .  agreed , it might be , but is far from being the best vampire flick ever .  period .  razor blade smile has some rather high production values , shown by the nice overall tone to the film .  the film is also a bit of a departure from popular vampire lore , with a vampire that can go out in broad daylight without disintegrating , doesn't sleep in a coffin ( but leaves one next to her computer ) , and sees religion as the `opium of the peoples' ( hence , immunity to crosses ) .  but aside from that , it doesn't stray too far away from horror film conventions .  that is , unless that is intentional .  razor blade smile literally goes for the throat , then pumps the wound full of processed cheese .  you can't help but laugh when a female vampire gets decapitated and her severed head goes flying into a puddle .  you'll laugh even harder at the hideously contrived situations ( to distract two female guards , lilith tosses a cellular phone towards them and dials the number ) .  you'll laugh the hardest when a murder witness recants the tale and suddenly starts sobbing uncontrollably .  and then , there's the sudden twist ending ( i have enough heart not to give it away ) .  the film refuses to take itself seriously , which is a good thing , as by the time lilith zips up her skin-tight body suit and then unzips it just to show the right amount of cleavage , you've most likely forgotten the main point of the story .  but in case you really care , she's been assigned to kill a bunch of people who belong to the so-called illuminati , and she's leaving a huge mess behind for the police to find .  as much as my criticisms , this movie works best as a guilty pleasure or as a film that you watch with your friends and within groups .  almost destined for cult-status , the film's campy , cheesy overtones actually work towards the film .  while this may not necessarily be the film you'd want to be seen watching by yourself , it makes for a fun time at the movies .

"  now , sadly , he's added " eyes wide shut " to that impeccable body of work and his final film is the first and only blot on his near-flawless copybook .  kubrick , alas , should have quit while he was ahead .  this much-publicized psycho-sexual tease-a-thon , with its star billing of real-life marrieds tom cruise and nicole kidman , is nothing more than one long ( two-and-a-half hours long ) boring exercise that features kubrick operating with talent wide shut .  kubrick , faithless to arthur schnitzler's 1926 novella " dream story , " has confused eroticism with nudity .  he has confused intellectualism with talking slowly .  he has confused profundity with pretentiousness .  in addition , the director has made some strange casting choices , leaving sydney pollack in and leaving accomplished performers harvey keitel and jennifer jason leigh out .  pollack , the director of such box-office hits as " tootsie " and " out of africa , " is normally solid in his occasional acting stints but here he's miserably out of his depth . . .  and there isn't much depth to begin with !  unhappily , there's not likely to be a director's cut of this film to determine whether the decision to exorcise keitel and leigh was the right one .  in fact , with the exception of the stark black-and-white credits , snatches of baroque music on the soundtrack , and many , many grainy tracking shots down lavishly-decorated corridors , there's none of kubrick's trademark brilliance in this film .  it doesn't help that the story , as delivered , is ridiculous .  cruise and kidman , who bring little more than marital torpor to the project , play well-to-do new yorkers bill and alice harford .  he's a doctor and she's an unemployed art gallery director and they share a central park west address .  at an opulent party hosted by their friend victor ziegler ( pollack ) , alice gets a little tipsy and starts dancing with a jeremy irons-like hungarian , who's singularly determined to get her in the sack .  bill , too , is seen arm-in-arm with a couple of models before he's pulled away to deal with an overdoser .  back home , bill and alice smoke a little pot before alice's aggressive jealousy kicks in .  as retribution , she confesses to her husband that she once had deep feelings for a naval officer she eyeballed at a hotel where she and bill once stayed .  this hurtful admission sends bill into a tailspin ; he pounds the streets of the village in his heavy black overcoat struggling with black-and-white images of alice in the grip of a horny midshipman .  it's all way too much for him .  for revenge , bill almost has sex with a hooker .  he almost has feelings for a underage girl he sees in a costume store .  then he almost does the hooker's roommate .  and he's almost involved in an overblown rococo orgy when an old college chum of his tips him off to a mysterious , password-protected party where everyone wears masks and " the women are incredible " ( i . e . , naked ) .  this " erotic " set piece , a cult-ish bacchanal complete with chanting , incense , and lots of strategically-placed partygoers covering up the dirty , might impress the likes of hugh hefner , but it's a lot less shocking than it's intended to be .  what's the big deal ?  bill doesn't exactly * do * anything ( other than throw his money and credentials around ) , and alice only ever lusted in her heart .  whoop-dee-doo .  still , they make up at the same agonizingly slow pace--was kubrick , notorious for multiple takes , paying them at an hourly rate ?  even geniuses have their bad days .   " eyes wide shut " just happens to be kubrick's bad day , an unerotic , disappointing , and altogether pointless end to an otherwise memorable career .

neg@ pos neg i have never seen a man so in love with himself than george lucas .  with the overt success of the three original star wars films , lucas has become , not necessarily a filmmaker , but the head cheeze at a huge toy company , with the phantom menace the new product on the shelve .  only this toy was made for $115 million , but every kid wants it , and , like all other expensive toys , falls apart within an hour after playing with it .  the product in question , star wars episode 1 : the phantom menace ( jeez ! ) , is pure and simple : its about the money , baby !  no one in their right mind would create such a fiasco if they knew it wouldn't make a ton of money before its fourth week of release .  i come to the sw franchise as a stranger , since i have absolutely no idea why the sw movies are so popular .  i find them rather boring and full of nothing but eye candy .  phantom menace is like the first sw , minus 10 .  nothing in the whole concept is remotely enjoyable .  even the special effects seem rather bland .  the story in this new one is a mindless mess . . . the  acting wooden . . . and the action sequences like something out of a video game .  sw : phantom menace is one of the worst films of the year so far .  with a title like sw e1 : tpm , lucas has one big head on those shoulders .  i thought chris carter did for releasing an x-files movie , although , that movie adaptation was an excellent way to spend two hours .  pm is one long headache . 
pos@ pos neg having not seen , " who framed roger rabbit " in over 10 years , and not remembering much besides that i liked it then , i decided to rent it recently .  watching it i was struck by just how brilliant a film it is .  aside from the fact that it's a milestone in animation in movies ( it's the first film to combine real actors and cartoon characters , have them interact , and make it convincingly real ) and a great entertainment it's also quite an effective comedy/mystery .  while the plot may be somewhat familiar the characters are original , especially baby herman , and watching them together is a lot of fun .  the story begins in hollywood in 1947 .  cartoon star roger rabbit is blowing takes and having trouble keeping his mind on work , so hard-boiled private detective eddie valiant ( bob hoskins ) is called in by studio head r . k .  maroon ( alan tilvern ) to try to help get roger's mind back on work .  maroon thinks that roger's wife , jessica's , possible unfaithfulness to him might be the cause of distraction and tells eddie to get some photos of her in the act before it costs him any more money in reshoots .  valiant takes some photos of jessica playing , `patty cake' with marvin acme ( stubby kaye ) , the owner of toontown ( where all of the cartoon characters live ) and takes them to maroon .  upon seeing them , roger is emotionally destroyed and soon after acme is found dead and roger rabbit is the prime suspect .  the rest of the movie follows valiant and roger as they run around town ( and eventually toontown ) trying to clear roger's good name .  along the way they meet judge doom ( christopher lloyd ) a judge-jury-and executioner type who's out to get roger and has discovered the one and only way to kill a `toon . '  `who framed roger rabbit' won 4 academy awards including a special achievement award for richard williams for animation direction and creation of the cartoon characters ( williams and his teams went through the film frame by frame and hand drew the cartoon characters in ) .  director robert zemekis must be given an equal amount of praise for overseeing the entire production , which included hundreds of animators .  also bob hoskins' performance should be credited .  he , in addition to the rest of the human cast , finds the right note to play in all of the scenes with his cartoon co-stars .  according to the internet movie database , hoskins studied his young daughter to learn how to act with imaginary characters and i guess his hard work paid off .  `who framed roger rabbit' is a rare film .  one that not only presented a great challenge to the filmmakers but one that can be enjoyed by the whole family ( although some very young viewers may be a little scared by judge doom ) .  do yourself a favor and rent it , `p-p-p-p-please .

neg@ pos neg i'll be the first to admit it .  when you mention the book great expectations , i immediately begin experiencing flashbacks to junior high english class , where i was confronted with a torturously boring book filled with people with such nonsensical names as pip and magwitch .  yes , it's a classic of literature , but it was a rather dry one , shoved down my young throat like a spoonful of bitter medicine .  certainly , the experience wasn't truly that bad , but , to quote ethan hawke in the latest movie adaptation of said book , " i'm not going to tell the story the way it happened . . . i'll  gonna tell it the way i remember it . "  anyway , to return from nostalgia lane , and get back to the present , hollywood , in it's trendy attempt to modernize the classics , now presents an updated film version of great expectations .  instead of pip , this time the central character is named finn ( played as a boy by jeremy kissner , and by ethan hawke as an adult ) .  finn is an orphan being raised by his unfaithful sister maggie , or should that be mrs . joe , ( kim dickens ) , and her boorish fisherman husband , joe ( chris cooper ) .  the setting is the florida coast during the mid-70s .  finn is a blooming artist , and spends his time running around the beach drawing fish ( one of his two favorite subjects ) .  during one of these escapades , he literally stumbles upon an escaped criminal ( robert deniro ) .  borrowing a page from the superhuman max cady , deniro's criminal has a seemingly limitless lung capacity , and favors hiding on the ocean floor .  ok . . . maybe  that's an exaggeration , but he certainly beats any of houdini's records in the opening scenes of the film .  and that's nothing next to the fuel efficiency of finn's motorboat , but i digress .  anyway , finn does the convict a good deed , just to show that he's a really swell guy .  and then the plot moves on .  enter miss havisham . . . or  ms . dinsmoor here ( anne bancroft ) .  abandoned at the altar some 26 years ago , ms . dinsmoor is the epitome of the crazy rich old maid .  with bizarre clothing , eccentric mannerisms and a few pounds of makeup , anne bancroft seriously overacts in this role .  although she ends up nowhere near a believable character , she does add some humor to the film .  joe is hired to help with the gardening at her unkempt manner , but the insane ms . dinsmoor soon hires finn to be a plaything for her niece , estella ( raquel beaudene as a young girl , gwyneth paltrow as an adult ) .  for no apparent reason , other than to provide the main plot of the film , finn is instantly stricken for the estella .  perhaps it's her snooty attitude or her utter disdain for his person , or maybe finn has simply never met a girl before .  in any case , neither as children nor adults , chemistry simply doesn't exist between the two , and yet finn spends the remainder of the film pining for her .  even when , as an adult , finn arrives in new york at the behest of a mysterious benefactor , reacquaints himself with estella , and draws her portrait in the nude , there's nothing .  in fact , there is more sexual tension between helen hunt and greg kinnear's gay artist during a similar scene in as good as it gets .  at this point , the audience has grown as cold and detached as estella's character , and couldn't care less about the two characters .  the bulk of the blame here falls upon gwyneth paltrow .  she fails to imbue estella , a remote character in the book , with even the vaguest traces of humanity .  there's obviously something wrong when , watching the film , you're more interested with how big her nose looks in silhouette than you are about her character .  without a strong estella , finn's obsession seems baseless .  you wish he would just stop whining , let estella marry his rival , walter plane ( an oddly subdued hank azaria ) , and just get on with his life .  in fact , the two relationships that work in the film are purely tangential to the main plot .  finn's relationship with his brother-in-law , joe , is interesting , if a bit stereotypical .  what's more fascinating are his interactions with deniro .  although it's only a bit part , it goes to show how much vitality a strong actor can create .  it is apparent that director alfonso cuarsn put a lot of work in creating the imagery of the film .  some of the shots work , but others are too obviously staged ( for example , both of the water fountain scenes ) to have any impact .  finn's art ( actually the creations of italian painter , francesco clemente ) is used throughout the film , but it mostly fails to have the intended effect .  we never see why finn would generate this style of art , which is simultaneously crude and insightful .  as a result , it ends up as distant as the rest of the film .  modernizing the classics is currently in vogue ( just see william shakespeare's romeo+juliet ) .  simply update the action to a modern setting , and apply plenty of modern rock .  but such adornments do little to perk up great expectations .  as much as i dreaded the novel when i first read it , you'd probably be better off suffering though a reading than watching this romanceless film . 
pos@ pos neg in these days of overlong movies ( meet joe black , the thin red line , the mask of zorro ) it is a shame that films like waking ned devine can't be longer than a paltry 90 minutes .  this is just a cute movie , even through its mildly risque subject matter .  old friends jackie ( bannen ) and michael ( kelley ) try to find the lottery winner ( they deduce must live in their dinky town of about 60 ) so that they might kiss up to him and share the winnings .  through process of elimination , they find that it must be lovable old ned devine , who they find sitting in front of his tv , clutching the winning lottery ticket in his cold dead hand .  what results is thuroughly amusing , as jackie tries to convince his wife that not claiming it would be wrong , and that they could really benefit .  after all , old ned won't miss it .  rather than divulge the later twists and turns , i'll stop here merely pointing out that jackie and michael get into all sorts of trouble in their little sleepy irish villiage .  bannen and kelly are a perfect pair .  one slightly stout , the other as thin as a rail .  both getting on in years , they make such a cute pair of old codgers .  waking ned devine may even be seen as a " full monty " for the geriatric set , especially since kelly gets buff-o for one amusing scene .  waking ned devine is by no means perfect , but it is so sincere and touching that it looks so much better than most films .  the performances by everyone in the town are great , particularly the two leads .  there is one twist at the end which i find unnecessary , but it hardly ruins the picture .  writer/director kirk jones should be held up as an example to all those hollywood screenwriters .  scripts as creative and endearing as this should be the norm , not the exception .  perhaps it makes us appreciate this wonderful film even more .  had i held off on my year's best/worst list for another day , waking ned devine ( officially released in late november of 98 ) surely would have graced the short group of the year's finest films .  it is light , but thought provoking and sweet .  i can't think of anyone who shouldn't see ( or wouldn't enjoy ) this film .

"  right for the beginning of " o brother " the coens grab your attention with a chain gang of prison inmates breaking rocks along the road in unison to a work song .  the camera flows around the hard toiling men , giving a visually exciting symmetry to the scene that ends with our three heroes - ulysses everett mcgill ( george clooney ) , delmar ( tim blake nelson ) and pete ( john turturro ) - escaping across a cotton field .  it is the beginning of a journey that takes on different meanings and urgencies to each member of the trio .  a strong suite , as always with the coen brothers , is the depth of character of the folks they create in their films .  their characters are goofy and comical , like nicolas cage in " raising arizona " ; or , dramatic , as albert finney and john turturro in " miller's crossing " ; and , even a mix of the two with frances mcdormand in " fargo . "  in all cases , and in " o brother , " too , the characters populating their films are three-dimensional people .  ulysses everett is a handsome , hair-obsessed petty criminal with a silver tongue and not a lot in the brains department .  but , he seems like a genius when compared to the simple , sweet delmar and the maladjusted pete , who follow their self appointed leader to a promised treasure of $1 . 2 million .  their odyssey takes on the mystical proportions of homer's original material as they meet all manner of people along the way , including those dangerous sirens who beckon them onto symbolically rocky shoals and a cyclops who beats them and takes all their money .  there is magic , too , when delmar believes that pete was turned into a horny toad by the sirens .  the story meanders through the different vignettes of the boys' adventures , giving the flick a choppy , episodic feel that disrupts the overall flow .  some of the interludes are an epiphany , though .  the trio becomes a quartet when they pick up guitar-playing tommy johnson ( chris thomas king ) and visit a radio station in the middle of nowhere , run by its blind owner ( stephen root ) .  they become the soggy bottom boys for the sightless radio station man and , without their knowledge , are recorded as they sing the traditional tune , " i am a man of constant sorrow . "  it is a wonderful moment of moviemaking and gives us , in my mind , the best movie song of the year .  contrasting this and other wonderful moments ( the sexy seduction by the sirens comes to mind ) are some pretentious bits that detract from the overall quality of " o brother . "  in particular , near the end , is a scene where ulysses , delmar and pete crash a ku klux klan rally to save tommy from being lynched .  the scene is overblown and flashy and reeks of " the wizard of oz . "  they don't say " lions and tigers and bears , oh my ! "  and there's no dorothy , but it is the land of oz we're seeing here .  the highs and lows of the story flow are tempered by fine acting on several levels .  george clooney is funny , charming , a little dumb and one of the handsomest actors in the business today .  he has the charm of a 30's movie idol and is able to put himself into silly situations with dignity .  ulysses has an ongoing obsession with his hair , risking life and limb to get a particular brand of pomade and a supply of hairnets .  his vanity will come to plague him as it would any mystical hero-wanderer .  while clooney is the name draw for " o brother , " the show stealer is tim blake nelson as delmar .  the heretofore unknown nelson is terrific as the simple convict who , at one point , hears the word of the lord and joins members of a church congregation in their mass baptism .  delmar is saved and dedicates his life to doing good and provides a richness to his simple character that makes him shine .  the taciturn pete , as played by longtime coen collaborator turturro , is the sullen member of the trio and gives them the necessary angst .  all together , the tuneful triumvirate is a mix of the three stooges and the three musketeers as they prove to be buffoons , albeit brave ones .  the colorful supporting cast is rampant with homerian characters to meet and get to know along the way of the boys' odyssey .  charles durning appears as incumbent governor pappy o'daniel , who keeps crossing paths with them in his bid for re-election .  john goodman is wicked as the one-eyed bible salesman and con artist , big dan teague .  michael badalucco is manic and outrageous as outlaw and bank robber extraordinary , george " babyface " nelson .  stephen root is amusing as the blind dj , rep'ing one of the many references to the sightless that abound in the film in mystical ways .  holly hunter is wasted in the small role as ulysses' estranged wife , penny ( and the real reason for this adventure , not secret treasure ) .  techs are , as expected in a coen brothers venture , first class .  cinematographer roger deakins , who has worked on five previous coen films , captures the sultry atmosphere of the south .  the photography complements the lush period production and costume provided by dennis gassner and mary zophres , respectively .  once again , roderick jaynes - the alter ego of ethan and joel coen - is on board as editor .  the high points outweigh the low through most of " o brother , where art thou ?

" french twist " ( the " cool " american title , not the real one , which was " gazon maudit , " literally meaning " twisted ground , " or something like that ) deals with a married couple with kids , and the intrusion of a stranger who kinda screws things up for them .  loli and alain chabat ( victoria abril and alain chabat ) are not exactly happily married .  always on business trips , alain chabat more than once cheats on her , and she eventually finds out .  and one day , she meets a butch mechanic , marijo ( the co-writer/director josiane balasko ) , and they two kinda hit it off .  so she decides she will get back at alain chabat by doing the obvious : sleeping with marijo .  but she soons starts to not only fall in love with marijo , but she's also realizes she's still in love with alain chabat .  so , of course , she does the obvious from that : she decides to keep them both .  she'll be ( and sleep ) with each of them for 3 days each , then on sunday , she'll rest by herself .  after all , she needs it if she's gonna have more sex than sylvia kristel .  the film goes on for over an hour and a half , through stupidity after stupidity , moronic twist after moronic twist , and soon there's the little ironic ( ! ! ! )  ending .  i know it's a completely different culture , and i'm quite familiar with the french and their cinema , but this is just bad .  none of the characters are more intelligent than peter stormare in " fargo " ( a movie where stupid characters were backed up to make a point ) , and any action they do is pretty much just to get a hopeful chuckle from the audience .  what's shocking is this was not only one of france's biggest hits , but it was nominated for a lot of cesars ( french equivalent of oscars ) .  the writing and directing is really the big problem with it .  josiane balasko does a good acting job with her role , but her little sex comedy isn't very humerous , entertaining , or even deep at all .  even woody allen's not-very-good " a midsummer night's sex comedy " is intelligent , well-written , and possesses some depth .  this is shallow , unfunny , and pretty annoying to watch .  the film moves at the pace of a snail , and is damn-near painful to watch .  thank god for the fast forward button .  the acting , however , isn't bad at all .  the actors do the best they can with the bad material , and victoria abril is pretty likable despite the script ( and the fact that she's stupid enough to try to divide herself over two people when she has kids ) .  and alain chabat has some funny moments as the neurotic husband .  but " french twist " is just pretty lame .  it's not overly horrible , and has a couple very , very , very brief moments .  but it's just a really crap film , and an example of an ill-advised distribution of a foreign film . 
pos@ pos neg well i'll be damned , what a most excellent surprise .  not to be confused with the campy and far inferior 1988 remake starring ex-porn star traci lords , this more recent attempt at remaking the 1950's drive-in schlockfest not of this earth is a real gem and was quite possibly the best sci-fi flick of 1995 .  once again , b-movie king roger corman is behind this effort ( he directed the original ) but this time he appears only in the role of executive producer .  the rest of the crew and cast are relative unknowns .  it seems criminal that the film was released direct to video in most countries , because it's an absolute must-see for sci-fi fans and a treat for anyone who enjoys decently acted and written thrillers with a kooky bent .  the plot in brief .  paul johnson ( michael york ) is an alien posing as an eccentric millionaire who , though needing to kill people to live , is visiting earth for far from selfish reasons .  his race is dying of a mysterious blood disease and he desperately is trying to find a cure , the key of which lies in the blood of humans .  he visits and soon puts under his spell the respected blood physician dr . rochelle , whom he hypnotises into doing secret research on his behalf .  he also has the doctor convince smart and sexy nurse amanda ( elizabeth barondes ) to move in with johnson as his private nurse so as to give him the blood transfusions which he constantly requires .  but before long , amanda and johnson's sleazy chauffeur release that johnson is a lot more than just eccentric .  i must admit , my first glimpse of the video cover for not of this earth was not encouraging .  british actor michael york has appeared in some real stinkers in past few decades , a far cry from the quality fare of his younger days such as caberat ( 1972 ) .  but his performance here as an alien in human disguise is nothing short of outstanding .  the weird twitches and bizarre modes of speech , the dapper clothes and cool spectacles , the unexpected pathos which he invests in his character .  york is by turns hilarious , menacing and tragic .  this is a tour-de-force and quite simply the best performance i've seen from him .  and while obviously made on a modest budget , the film boasts enormous strengths .  the casting is spot on , the acting is terrific and the script is intelligent , witty and consistently engaging , cleverly updating the original .  the balance of horror and humour is just about perfect , a marked contrast to the earlier remake from 1988 .  the film doesn't drag for a second of its 90 minute running time thanks to tight editing and the sure hand of little-known director terrance h . winkless .  and it doesn't matter one bit that the special effects are cheesy - this is schlock after all , even if it is high class schlock .  in fact my only criticism of the film is that things get a tad weak towards the end .  tighter direction could have given the climax more urgency and a few of the characters act rather illogically given their life-threatening situation .  but these are minor complaints .  just see it .  not of this earth is one of the biggest sci-fi surprises in years .  and michael york : in one cool swoop you've made yourself a b-movie legend , dude . 
neg@ pos neg arnold schwarzenegger has been an icon for action enthusiasts , since the late 80's , but lately his films have been very sloppy and the one-liners are getting worse .  it's hard seeing arnold as mr . freeze in batman and robin , especially when he says tons of ice jokes , but hey he got 15 million , what's it matter to him ?  once again arnold has signed to do another expensive blockbuster , that can't compare with the likes of the terminator series , true lies and even eraser .  in this so called dark thriller , the devil ( gabriel byrne ) has come upon earth , to impregnate a woman ( robin tunney ) which happens every 1000 years , and basically destroy the world , but apparently god has chosen one man , and that one man is jericho cane ( arnold himself ) .  with the help of a trusty sidekick ( kevin pollack ) , they will stop at nothing to let the devil take over the world !  parts of this are actually so absurd , that they would fit right in with dogma .  yes , the film is that weak , but it's better than the other blockbuster right now ( sleepy hollow ) , but it makes the world is not enough look like a 4 star film .  anyway , this definitely doesn't seem like an arnold movie .  it just wasn't the type of film you can see him doing .  sure he gave us a few chuckles with his well known one-liners , but he seemed confused as to where his character and the film was going .  it's understandable , especially when the ending had to be changed according to some sources .  aside form that , he still walked through it , much like he has in the past few films .  i'm sorry to say this arnold but maybe these are the end of your action days .  speaking of action , where was it in this film ?  there was hardly any explosions or fights .  the devil made a few places explode , but arnold wasn't kicking some devil butt .  the ending was changed to make it more spiritual , which undoubtedly ruined the film .  i was at least hoping for a cool ending if nothing else occurred , but once again i was let down .  i also don't know why the film took so long and cost so much .  there was really no super affects at all , unless you consider an invisible devil , who was in it for 5 minutes tops , worth the overpriced budget .  the budget should have gone into a better script , where at least audiences could be somewhat entertained instead of facing boredom .  it's pitiful to see how scripts like these get bought and made into a movie .  do they even read these things anymore ?  it sure doesn't seem like it .  thankfully gabriel's performance gave some light to this poor film .  when he walks down the street searching for robin tunney , you can't help but feel that he looked like a devil .  the guy is creepy looking anyway !  when it's all over , you're just glad it's the end of the movie .  don't bother to see this , if you're expecting a solid action flick , because it's neither solid nor does it have action .  it's just another movie that we are suckered in to seeing , due to a strategic marketing campaign .  save your money and see the world is not enough for an entertaining experience . 
pos@ pos neg it was a crazy time in france , what with the french revolution right around the corner .  king louis xv would soon die , and his son would become king louis xvi .  such is the setting for beaumarchais : the scoundrel about the controversial playwright , spy and playboy pierre-augustin caron de beaumarchais .  beaumarchais was the author of the plays , " the barber of seville " and " the marriage of figaro . "  today people think of them as quaint and harmless operas , but , back in 1773 when the movie takes place , they were so scandalous that beaumarchais was thrown into prison more than once .  the movie beaumarchais : the scoundrel takes a light-hearted approach to its subject , resulting in an inviting motion picture .  one of france's most expensive productions ever , the movie was a huge hit when it opened there last year .  now in theatrical release in the united states , it eschews the seriousness of most art house films with a romping good story .  the secret of the film's success , other than the lavishness of sylvie de segonzac's costumes , has to be the performance by fabrice luchini as beaumarchais .  with his glistening eyes and his infectious smile , he mesmerizes the camera and the audience .  his wry little lips seem always to hint at some unspoken deviousness he is planning .  in a land where court intrigue determines one's destiny , constant scheming was a way of life for the aristocracy .  as our story starts , we learn that beaumarchais has bought himself a judgeship .  into his court comes a member of the nobility demanding an immediate sword fight .  beaumarchais , who has been having an affair with the man's wife , makes him wait until the current case on the docket is decided .  that over with , the fight is on .  with luchini's charisma , it is hard to root for anyone other than him .  audiences may remember him from the marvelous colonel chabert , in which he played the attorney .  although he does not have half of the good looks of his assistant gudin , played by manuel blanc , he dazzles the women and the viewers with his grace and style .  michael epp's warm and intimate cinematography provides a nice accompaniment to jean-marc kerdelhue's lush but realistic looking sets .  jean-claude petit's music , especially the hauntingly lovely flute solos , make for an enchanting time at the movies .  director jean-claude brisville , who wrote the script along with edouard molinaro , fleshed out a play by sacha guitry which , according to the press notes , was just a series of historic vignettes .  the disorganization of the play still comes through at some points in the movie , but the actors smooth it over with their good-hearted style .  typical of the scenes that come out of nowhere is the one in which a rotund benjamin franklin appears in a large pot of hot water , taking his bath .  one episode has beaumarchais working with a renegade spy who may or may not be a man .  another has beaumarchais using his personal fortune to aid the american revolution .  all of this may sound like a dull historical drama , but it is anything but .  the story plays more like theater of the absurd than a movie based on historical facts .  the radiantly lovely sandrine kiberlain plays marie-therese , the real love of beaumarchais's life .  but he is so likable that members of the audience may want to compete with her for him .  still , with his beguiling smile , one can never quite be sure if you should trust him .  the movie , on the other hand , can be trusted to deliver a high old time .  beaumarchais : the scoundrel runs 1 : 41 .  it is in french with english subtitles .  the film is not rated but would be an r for some nudity and sex , and should be fine for most teenagers . 
neg@ pos neg i looked at the " internet movie database " 's awards section for this film , and found that this was nominated for a golden globe for " best picture ( drama ) . "  anyone who's seen this film can back me up on this : this is the worst of the " great " disaster films , and that's not really saying a lot for this film .   " earthquake " is basically notable because it originally included some theatre thing where the theatre shook when the big earthquake occured .  on video , it's a bland and slow-moving film which gives us a bunch of different characters ( the disaster film requisite ) , then brings them together in the struggle against the big disaster .  while this worked in , say , " the towering inferno , " it doesn't here for one single reason : we don't care about any of the characters .  the film gives us charlton heston ( in one of many crap 70s films he made , including " skyjacked " and that classic , " soylent green " ) as a rich man married to ava gardner , who is having a little affair with a young single mom ( genieveve bujold ) ; a renegade police officer on suspension ( george kennedy , in his least humored performance ) ; in the second weirdest subplot , a motorcycle stuntman ( richard roundtree , right after his " shaft " thing ) whose big stunt is he goes on a little track that goes upside down ( yea , snore ) ; and the weirdest subplot : a military man/bag boy at a grocery store who has a little thing for buxom victoria principal , and eventually gets vengeance on those guys who made fun of his hair ( ! ! ! ) .  in smaller subplots , there's a pointless bit about people who are flying over l . a . ( the city in the film , by the way ) , one who's playing cards and married to a boring non-acting husband ( you think this one can go nowhere ?  guess again . he gets interested in the final frames ) ; there's genieveve bujold's moron son , who has a little adventure with wires ; and for some much-needed comedy , there's walter matthau ( billed as walter mutha . . . .  - the only laugh in the film ) , as a wild drunkard , who's big moment is a dance he does at a critical time .  as for the actual " earthquake , " it's rather a let-down .  there's a full hour of character-setups , none of which is interesting , then about 10 minutes of shaking , crumbling , and a bit where a house almost falls on bujold ( narrowly missing ) .  this film needed that whole theatre-shaking : they needed to wake everybody up because they were so bored .  there's little suspense following the quake , although this film tries for it .  there's an adventure in a crumbling high-rise office building , the wires with the kid , and the movement of people who are all injured .  but none of these are all-too suspenseful .  the finale with the heston/gardner/bujold love triangle is ended in a basic flip-of-the-coin bit , which brings out a big let-down .  and there's no real finale .  even " volcano " ended nicely , and that movie really sucked .  not only is it hokey , but you don't care about any character .  who cares if heston dies ?  who cares if he choses bujold or gardner ( although i would have chosen gardner , mainly on the basis that she can actually act ) ?  who cares if richard roundtree makes money on his stupid " stunt ? "  who cares if that idiot kid falls to his death on some wires ?  and who cares about that whole plane spiel ?  if anything , " earthquake " is worth a viewing for the same reason " glen or glenda ? "  is .  i mean , i laughed at this more than i did at " bio dome . "  but that's another story ( and review ) .  in short , " earthquake " gives disaster pics a bad name . 
pos@ pos neg in may of 1977 , just 2 years after steven spielberg's success with jaws and 3 years after francis coppolas' the godfather , a risky , ambitious young director named george lucas went for the same unpredictable box office success .  little did he know that star wars would become the greatest science fiction epic in the history of film .  in january of this year , lucas re-released star wars on its 20th anniversary .  in this new , remastered version , the added effects , which range from leathery desert beasts inserted into already existing shots to an awkward new scene in which hans solo bargains his way out of a jam with a computer-generated jabba the hutt , don't do much but call attention to themselves .  other than these , the film is exactly the same .  why pay to see it in the theaters , you might ask ?  simply because when this movie was released , most of us were a few years short of being born .  we should all get up and go to the movies for the experience , especially if you haven't seen it .  the plot is basic but in the same way , complex .  it has many themes , but the one rotates around luke skywalker ( mark hamill ) and his quest to become a jedi knight .  his mission begins when a droid named r2-d2 plays back a secret message recorded by the beautiful princess leia ( carrie fisher ) , which tells him to contact the mysterious obi-wan kanoby ( alec guiness ) .  he and kanoby then , joined by two inter-galactic renegades , hans solo ( harrison ford ) and chewbacca , and skywalker's two droids d2 and c3po ( the voice of anthony edwards ) , wage war upon the corrupt empire , commanded by an evil general ( peter cushing ) and the traitorous darth vader ( the voice of james earl jones ) .  skywalker defeats the evil empire by rising out of himself to embrace something larger : the force .  the film is obviously quite star-studded .  but how was lucas to know that ford would become one of the most sought after men in hollywood and jones' voice would appear so many more times in the future ?  it just happened to work out for him .  the magic of star wars lies in the way that skywalker's triumph is symbolized by the audience's sense of becoming something larger than life itself-a universe of fans , young and old , recreating a movie atmosphere that will impress generations forever .   , 
neg@ pos neg the previews for the movie are pretty good .  they show a little plot , all the characters , and the emotional highlights , all spliced together to give a general impression of the script .  unfortunately , the full movie adds nothing but 115 minutes .  the residents of mystery love hockey .  mystery and hockey go together like texas and high school football .  the townsfolk love hockey so much that they even acquit a player who's guilty of shooting another man ( yes , that's one of the movie's jokes . )  every saturday , the best players pair off for a game , and the whole town comes to watch .  the town's prodigal son charlie ( hank azaria ) wrote an article on the weekly game for sports illustrated .  mystery's national fame has the town abuzz .  a week later , charlie actually shows up in person , and he brings with him an offer from the nhl .  the new york rangers will come to mystery to play the locals .  the mysterians see this as both good and bad .  on the one hand , they'd love to have the fame and the money of such an exhibition .  on the other hand , they don't want to turn up as the butt of leno and letterman jokes .  the movie follows a handful of lives that are affected by the proposition .  biebe ( russell crowe ) has just been retired from the team and is asked to coach the boys , including his new replacement .  he's already resentful , and to top it off charlie has been making eyes at his wife .  crowe is not given a lot of room to act in this film , so he's just kind of stuck with constantly brooding .  charlie , meanwhile , is resentful of having born in a town where hockey is the only measure of a man's worth .  his " gift " of the feature story , and of the new york rangers , was his way of compensating for not being a better skater .  he hoped it would earn him some respect and merit , but the townspeople find reasons to continue disliking him .  burt reynolds could have been interesting as walter , the judge whose courtroom was befouled by a moronic jury of hockey fans .  walter actually has some experience with collegiate hockey , but he actively tries to put it behind him .  he wants his son to take the game more seriously , but he wants his community to just get over it .  reynolds could have been good , but sloppy writing and/or editing keep walter in the corner , and so reynolds never really gets to pull his performance all together .  one character actually was interesting .  biebe's wife ( mary mccormack ) , like the judge , understood that there was more to life than hockey .  but unlike him she has come to accept the skewed view of the community .  she chose the town and her husband with her eyes wide open .  her unique insight is verbalized once , and it lasts only a scene before it is gone , but her performance carries the hint of some deeper wisdom .  mysterty , alaska follows a handful of other characters , but none are well developed or worth mentioning .  the biggest problem with this movie is that there is no real heart to the story , no underlying thing that the movie is really about .  instead , roach and screenwriters david e . kelley and sean o'byrne try to cram the entire human condition into this sports comedy .  they try to make you laugh and cry , to feel outrage and pride .  they present the framing and cadence for jokes , but there's nothing truly funny .  they show appropriately staged scenes of sadness , but they give you nothing to be really sad about .  as columnist molly ivins would say , it's all hat , no cattle .  the perfect opportunity arises for roach to say what this movie is really about .  there is a funeral scene , played with appropriate gravity and somber music .  it is a chance for the characters to reflect on their lives and decide what's truly important .  russell crowe steps forward to speak , about to spell out the movie's metaphor for us .  he says that what really matters in life is " community . . . . "  then adds " and hockey . "  i guess these mysterians really are as shallow as they appear .  only mildly bad , mystery , alaska probably deserves 2 stars .  i even laughed out loud , genuine laughs in places .  but i docked it an extra half star when mike myers , a friend of roach , turned up in a role that didn't suit him .  myers is a comic character actor .  he puts on masks , becomes an outrageous caricature , and is funny .  he's great as austin powers , dr . evil , or any of his scottish characters .  nobody else in mysterty , alaska is a comic caricature .  all the other people have the feel of dramatic characters in semi-serious roles .  for roach to bring in myers for a few cheap laughs shows incredible contempt toward the rest of his cast , toward his audience , and indeed toward the film itself .  it's an acknowledgment by the director that the film is not worth taking seriously . 
pos@ pos neg virtual reality is a topic that has almost defined its own genre .  since 'dark city' ( 1998 ) , films about alternative universes and parallel worlds have been coming one after another .  the most popular and original of them all has been the matrix .  all the films released after it , have been less successful .  david cronenberg's existenz , released only a couple of months after the matrix , was accepted and even appreciated ( by some ) , but the hype was gone .  and when 'the thirteenth floor' aired this fall , it was completely overseen and ignored .  i admit that this issue has become something between tiring and annoying , feeling like eating the same meal over and over again .  it was therefore i was less than excited , when i went out to see to 'the thirteenth floor' .  however , i was positively surprised by josef rusnak's latest picture .  matrix was an entertaining thrill ride through dreams and reality , combining the best of hollywood's action and effects with an intelligent story .  existenz was a violent , gory and unsettling journey through reality and virtual reality , ending in blood and madness .  'the thirteenth floor' is somewhere in between .  instead of going after the crowds - the action audience ( like the matrix ) , or aiming at the horror fans ( like existenz ) , 'the thirteenth floor' presents a more intelligent plot , witch will provide a less entertaining and more serious experience , that the true science fiction lovers will find rewarding .  in a near future . . . on  the thirteenth floor of a classified building , a genius scientist , hannon fuller , has created a simulated world , his personal dreamworld , where every inhabitant is a complex , selflearning program that only believes it is real .  right after the first testing of this world , fuller ( ) is found murdered .  douglas hall ( ) , his closest friend and business partner , immediately becomes the prime suspect and must enter through the thirteenth floor in search of the truth .  a beautiful woman ( gretchen mol ) who suddenly appears on the scene may hold the key to the mystery , which might unravel the horrifying truth about his own existence .  the first " download into simulation " is impressive .  it is the creator's first visit to his world , his creation .  in order to enter this virtual universe , you have to take over someone's identity , become another person .  this is called conciseness transfer , and this is part of the tragedy in the film : people " wake up " in unknown places and strange things start happen .  they start to doubt in their own sanity .  these innocent people pay for the mistakes of their " users " and creators with their sanity and their lives .  it is a frightening reality ; the fact that all the people in the simulation ( the program links ) are living out their lives , oblivious , not knowing that they are puppets in someone's fantasy .  with an appealing ( " blade runner " - type ) of detective story , this film presents the beauty and possibilities of virtual reality and the lurking danger that is always present .  our modern world is metal and glass -- cold , unfriendly , impersonal .  the thirties are different -- colorful , beautiful , elegant , virile .  this contrast demonstrates a wish for change .  virtual reality is here portrayed as a magical , enchanting power that seduces you into its endless possibilities .  to some it is just a journey to their personal paradise , to some a personal playground -- a life without any consequences .  for others - a way to start over and " correct " their mistakes , by living in an illusion of their past .  virtual reality is a wizard that transforms your hopes , dreams and fantasies to life .  at least that's how it is all beginning .  but when you're waking up from your dream , the real world seems worthless and unreal and all you can think off is returning to your personal paradise .  this , almost narcotic effect , soon turns into confusion and ultimately madness .  some important and interesting philosophical questions are raised -- what is real ?  what is thought ?  who are we ?  if these were answered , this film would be the greatest science fiction ever made .  they are off course not answered , but posed in an intelligent manner .  the visual aspect of the film is one of the key elements , since it portrays the contrast between these computer-simulated universes .  kirk m . petrucelli has done a marvelous job with the recreation of the thirties with its glamour , grace and color ; and setting this world in opposition to our own -- an almost caricatured recreation of the nineties .  there are some honest and decent performances by an almost unknown cast and harald klose's moody musical score that is at in right place at the right time .  a rather unusual thing about'the thirteenth floor' is the almost complete lack of special effects .  there are no cgi animated creatures , no bullets in slow motion .  this is a more philosophical approach , reminding about the european way of filmmaking .  this is off course a major disappointment to the audience that is used to endless gunfights and mutated amphibians , but the more serious science fiction buffs and 'dark city'-fans will be pleased .  this film is interesting and inspiring .  it has everything existenz doesn't , but it lacks the immediacy and intensity of the matrix .  and then there is a happy end which , like in 'dark city' , completely alienates it from the rest of the story and context .  the plot itself is not as original as the filmmakers want us to think , since they have virtually sucked out all information from the best science fiction classics , including blade runner and 'dark city' .  with this in mind , 'the thirteenth floor' doesn't make an oscar candidate or a film that will be remembered a year from now , yet this is a beautiful , elegant and intelligent take on virtual reality . 
neg@ pos neg vikings v . bears ?  no , this isn't the lineup for monday night football .  rather , these are the two opposing forces that will battle to the death in " the 13th warrior , " a film that is as dramatically flat as it is gratuitously gory .  based on michael crichton's book , eaters of the dead , this viking saga tries to evoke the mysticism of fabled norsemen and the glorious battles that they fought .  their strength and honor would eventually etch their place in history among the greatest warriors that ever picked up a sword .  luckily for the vikings , however , their warring abilities were not as clumsy as this film .  antonio bandaras is ahmed , a travelling ambassador .  accompanied by his friend ( omar shariff in a cameo ) , they eventually come across a small viking village .  we see that the vikings are an extremely proud group whose greatest strength is their fortitude .  they laugh heartily , revel in their arrogance , and sing songs of battles won .  but their festivities are about to be halted when a messenger boy arrives to tell the village leader that a great evil is threatening their land .  help is needed quickly .  an elderly , fortune-telling witch arrives .  after a brief incantation , she proclaims that 12 warriors and one more " not of norse blood " are needed to ensure victory .  personally , i always wonder why people believe these oracles when they look so haggardly and on the brink of insanity .  nonetheless , 12 men eagerly accept their place while ahmed becomes the pivotal 13th .  the group then sets out to do the greatest battle of their lives .  of course during their ride , ahmed becomes the target of fun for the other 12 burly viking warriors .  but he ably shows that it's not the size of the dog in the fight but rather the size of the fight in the dog .  he is able to overcome the proud arrogance of the vikings , but will his skills ( and that of the group ) be enough to defeat whatever evil is menacing the countryside ?  it does not look promising .  these creatures , resembling bears , are strong and have high morale .  they are fearless and display a desire for decapitating the heads of their enemies .  they attack by the hundreds and the next strike will come soon .  the warriors prepare their defenses and pray to their gods .  they are ready to sacrifice their lives .   " this is a good way to die , " says one of the fallen warriors .  despite the larger-than-life battle sequences , i was unmoved by the entire experience .  at many points , i was even confused .  for example , somewhere in the middle of the film , a sub-plot creeps up involving the prince of the threatened land .  he seems to have an agenda to elevate himself to greater power during this crisis .  however , the sub-plot never fully materializes , and we are left scratching our heads as to the purpose of its inclusion .  there are other questions that i had , but the real problem was that the story ( little of it that there was ) offered no characters to love or hate .  the leader of the viking warriors had the most charisma .  however , banderas's role is completely underwritten and it is unclear why being the 13th warrior makes him so special .  an entire rewrite of the ahmed character is in order .  also , much of the action takes place during torrential downpours or at night , which made battles very difficult to follow .  i would have preferred more time looking at the viking culture and how their beliefs shaped their decision to do battle against the enemy .  as it stands , the film manages more confusion than intensity .  it would make thor cry . 
pos@ pos neg perhaps the most dramatic changes in the motion picture industry in this decade have to do with special effects .  there is no question that action-adventure and science-fiction/action movies are now judged by the character of their light and noise .  whereas classic adventure pics of the last twenty years , such as raiders of the lost ark , were made in grand traditional fashion ; contemporary films like jurassic park are multimillion-dollar creations of computer technology .  the latest in this visually awesome series of movies , the wachowski brothers' the matrix , is a testament to the skilled use of special effects and its ability to enhance a movie's story .  unlike many sci-fi movies which promote themselves as effects-heavy blockbusters but fail to deliver on that promise , the matrix is a carefully constructed special effects event .  it runs 135 minutes in length and employs a countless number of computerized tricks which range from gimmick to grandiose , and the quality of the effects remains constant throughout the film's length .  contrary to popular trend , the matrix commits itself to being a spectacle of light and sound .  in this regard , the movie is something like a card sharp .  with its flashy mass stripped away , the matrix would be quite shallow and untalented .  the script is characteristically weak , and the dialogue suffers in lieu of a far more innovative visual approach .  but , like the card sharp , the matrix wows its audience to such a high degree that actual content is irrelevent .  the viewers don't care about what the matrix has to say as long as the next special effects sequence is right around the corner .  and right around the corner they usually are , for the script tells a fast-paced , albeit frequently revisited story .  as the movie explains , the world as we know it is nothing but an elaborate computer program constructed by an artificial intelligence for the purpose of placating mankind .  billions of human beings lie in this dormant state while the intelligence -- the matrix -- " farms " our life energy .  only a select group of individuals knows of the " real " world , and a particularly ingenious squad of these rebels is led by ultra-cool morpheus ( laurence fishburne ) .  morpheus and his crew recruit a computer expert named neo ( keanu reeves ) , believing he is a prophesied individual who will help them overthrow the matrix and return peace to earth .  the cast plays out this story in stylish fashion .  the set design is very dynamic , running the gambit between cramped and dreary to bright and airy .  the costumes , as well as the actors who wear them , add to the roles .  for instance , the manifested antagonists in the movie , a group of " agents " created by the matrix in its computer program , all dress in matching secret servicewear ; the rebel fighters , on the other hand , dress in rich hues of leather .  the casting cannot be criticized , for the typically stoic reeves isn't required to say much and laurence fishburne gets plenty of time to be so damn cool .  supports in carrie-anne moss , joe pantoliano , and hugo weaving are all effectual .  one of the best comparisons to thw matrix is last year's science fiction masterpiece dark city , particularly if one ponders how this same premise would've worked from a different approach .  the alex proyas film was far more dark and introspective , requiring a bit of thought before themes became clear ; here , the wachowski brothers have managed to construct a thrill-ride motion picture with little abandon and much noise .  the better picture between the two depends on the viewer , but the key to the success of the matrix is that the noise did not get in the way of the fun . 
neg@ pos neg attention moviegoers : you are about to enter a meaning-free zone .  should the sound system malfunction during your viewing of 200 cigarettes , do not panic .  the film will work just as well as a silent movie .  chronicling the meaningless lives of vain , yuppie types , the movie covers the same ground as the wilt stillman films ( last days of disco , barcelona and metropolitan ) but without any of his acerbic wit and the inviting style of his writing .  first-time writer shana larsen makes the mistake of creating a couple of dozen characters and not giving any of them any depth .  there isn't one of these characters worth caring about .  the movie features such a cornucopia of hot young stars that it looks like a celluloid version of " people magazine . "  among others , the movie features : ben affleck , casey affleck , david chappelle , janeane garofalo , gaby hoffmann , catherine kellner , courtney love , jay mohr , martha plimpton , christina ricci and paul rudd .  and unlike people magazine , the people speak , not that they have anything interesting to say .  it's new year's eve in 1981 , and monica ( martha plimpton ) is preparing her big party .  structured as a series of relatively unrelated stories about her guests on the way to the party , director risa bramon garcia flits back and forth among her stars .  monica's apartment is in " noho , " an area that one of the guests describes as " so cool , all of the poor people live there . "  typical of the shallow couples in the movie are kevin ( paul rudd ) and his friend and would-be sexual partner lucy ( courtney love ) .  they argue about whether lucy is a slut or not since she sleeps with everyone , except him , of course .  she dares him to go immediately to a bathroom stall and have sex with her , which turns out to be neither erotic , funny or successful -- rather like the rest of the story .  the movie gets its title from the carton of cigarettes that lucy gives kevin for his new year's eve birthday .   " cigarettes are a shield against emotional interaction with other people , " kevin later tells lucy in a snippet of dialog that sounds profound only outside the context of the movie .  another character , played by jay mohr , has a problem with his sexual triumphs .  every woman he beds falls deeply in love with him by the next morning .  when his latest conquest tells him of her affection for him , his response is " i like a lot of people . "  as the movie finally draws to a close , the characters awaken from their post-party game of musical beds .  some have passed out early from alcohol abuse and remember little , while others actually have some clue as to what happened .  the movie itself is so forgettable that by the time you reach your car in the parking lot , all trace of the film will have vanished from your mind , which is probably the best thing that can be said about the movie .  200 cigarettes runs 1 : 40 .  it is rated r for profanity , sex and one dope smoking scene and would be acceptable for older teenagers . 
pos@ pos neg titanic is , without a doubt , the best movie i've seen all year .  and believe me , i'm not an easy critic to impress : the english patient was too long , men in black was over-hyped , and several of the " big summer releases " were dead in the water .  thank god this film got delayed until december .  it's my christmas present .  titanic is in the tradition of the old hollywood epics of years-gone-by , and it is truly a stunning film .  while watching this picture you are completely mesmerized , never taking your eyes off the screen , nor checking your watch to see how much longer it's gonna last , despite its 3 hour plus running time .  as a friend of mine , who's a true titanic-buff , said " if someone doesn't like this film , it's because they didn't want to . "  truer words are hard to come by .  of course , it doesn't hurt that this film comes from one of my favorite directors , james cameron , who is unarguably the greatest action director of all time .  if you wish to argue that point with me , look at his list of credits : the terminator , aliens , the abyss , terminator 2 , true lies , etc . still care to disagree ?  not only has cameron helmed the directorial duties of this film , he also wrote , produced , and edited it .  and to show his true faith for the project , he renenged all directing fees and percentage points to ease the budget costs .  it's obvious he truly loves titanic .  the film opens with footage , both real and fake , of an underwater excursion by special submarines to the bottom of the atlantic , where a team of explorers lead by bill paxton are searcing for a diamond called the " heart of the ocean " , which , according to bill paxton's character , would be worth more than the hope diamond today .  their search turns up , dissapointly , no diamond , but instead a drawing of a young woman wearing the diamond .  this picture is broadcast on cnn and is seen by a 101 year old woman named rose , who claims to be the girl in the picture .  she is flown out to sea to meet bill paxton and to tell them about the diamond .  almost all of the rest of the movie is her narration of the past .  rose's narration shows us how she was an unhappy young girl , engaged to a rich man named cal hockley ( billy zane ) that she didn't want to marry .  her mother is pushy and obnoxious , and cal hockley is arrogant .  they are boarding the titanic , which is sailing to america , and this is where she is to marry cal .  meanwhile , a young man named jack dawson ( leonardo dicaprio ) and his italian friend ( danny nucci ) win two 3rd class tickets aboard the titanic in a poker game .  they are overjoyed , and rush aboard just as the boat is leaving .  for them , this is their ticket to america , to a better life .  for rose , she is sailing to her doom .  the first hour and a half or so of titanic tells the story of how rose dewitt ( kate winslet ) and jack dawson fall in love .  it's the classic wrong-side-of-the-tracks story , and does sometimes resort to a few cliches .  but as i said above , the love portion isn't sappy and doesn't " weigh the film down " , as some critics have said .  it's sweet , and it didn't make me restless at all , despite the fact that i usually hate love stories .  of course , it might help that cameron introduces some pretty interesting characters to help keep our eyes glued to the screen .  most of these people actually were passengers on the titanic back in 1912 , including the enigmatic molly brown ( played by the talented kathy bates ) , the captain of titanic ( bernard hill ) , and so on .  all of these characters add an extra depth to the film , and make it that easier to watch .  of course , things really start to get going after the hour and a half mark , where the titanic strikes the iceberg and begins a slow sink to the bottom .  the sinking is depicted realisticly , and the effects are truly amazing .  it is not told in a heroic fashion sense either , as people are portrayed as panicking , pushing others aside to get on the limited lifeboats , and drowning and dying horrible deaths .  the best part of the movie , in my opinion , comes at the very end , when we flash back to the future .  the crew , who at first had been skeptical of rose's story , now are totally aborbed by her .  rose goes out onto the ship's ledge , and we then learn a secret about her that catches us off guard .  we then see a dream of rose's , in which she returns to the titanic and is dancing with jack dawson .  most people i talked with after the movie saw this as only a dream .  however , i think it symbolized more ; i think it meant that rose had died , and is going to a sort of heaven , which would be the happiest part of her life : her and her one true love , jack .  if anyone has seen the movie and would like to voice an opinion about this , e-mail me at venom8!hotmail . com . 
neg@ pos neg the rich legacy of cinema has left us with certain indelible images .  the tinkling christmas tree bell in " it's a wonderful life . "  bogie's speech at the airport in " casablanca . "  little elliott's flying bicycle , silhouetted by the moon in " e . t . "  and now , " starship troopers " director paul verhoeven adds one more image that will live in our memories forever : doogie houser doing a vulcan mind meld with a giant slug .   " starship troopers , " loosely based on the robert heinlein novel , is the story of an interstellar war between humans and giant insects .  in the hands of verhoeven , the mammoth sci-fi battle flick is one of the most astonishingly bad films ever made , a monument to inept filmmaking on a colossal scale .  to put it simply , it's a bug bomb .  in " robocop " and " total recall , " verhoeven displayed a gift for creating an entertaining mix of violence , special effects and social satire , and " starship troopers " starts off in similar fashion , with a tongue-in-cheek futuristic military recruitment ad that shows promise .  things go downhill fast , though , as we meet our heroes , a group of buenos aires teens preparing to graduate from high school .  inexplicably , johnny rico , carmen ibenez , dizzy flores and xander barcalow are played by square-jawed anglo kids who look like they just stepped out of a mountain dew commercial .  it's a veritable " alpha centuri 90210 " as we watch the love-smitten teens squabble in the name of love .  michael ironside plays their teacher , who waves around a cheesy fake severed arm while lecturing about civic responsibilities .  eventually , the kids join the military , with dreams of glory in their addled little minds .  one of their classmates , carl jenkins ( " doogie houser's " neil patrick harris , ) snags a job in military intelligence because of his strong psychic abilities .  he displays his gift by psychically ordering a pet ferret to crawl up his mother's leg .  a long , dull boot camp sequence follows , enlivened only by an extended coed shower scene where the recruits swap snappy banter as the " showgirls " director's camera roams over their buff bodies .  finally , a full hour into the film , the war finally starts and we meet the enemy .  the bugs hail from klendathu and colonize planets by hurling their spores into space .  they attack starships by spinning around and firing deadly plasma blasts from their rears .  yes , incredible as it seems , the bugs actually kill with cosmic farts .  a phenomenally large amount of money was spent creating the computer animated insects and the results are mixed at best .  sweeping distant shots depicting hordes of giant bugs racing to attack are both impressive and scary , but the close-ups are a different matter .  the insects have an odd , artificial look , like origami creations with a mottled plastic coating .  the attack scenes are intensely violent , as one would expect from verhoeven , but the overall look is too phony to generate any real tension .  while the action is frantic , the military strategy , wildly illogical even by hollywood standards , grows tiresome quickly .  verhoeven tries to spice things up by throwing in more satiric news coverage , but the faux-jingoistic scenes of children " doing their part for the war effort " by squishing roaches on a sidewalk aren't enough to make up for the long stretches of sheer dreck .  one can only guess what paul verhoeven was trying to do here .  his customary one part satire , two parts ultra-violence formula is way out of whack , and most of the film just flounders .  in " showgirls " fashion , some scenes are almost bad enough to be good .  an intergalactic kegger party , with jake busey playing " dixie " on a green plexiglas fiddle , has a certain bizarre appeal .  a sex scene between two of the teens achieves a smarmy charm , enhanced a few minutes later when the female receives a fatal jab from a bug , but tells her hero that she doesn't mind dying .   " it's okay , " she gasps , " i got to have you ! "  and then , of course , there's doogie's mind meld with a bug .  it's possible that verhoeven was attempting to create an homage to the era of the original novel .  heinlein's pre- " stranger in a strange land " books were aimed at adolescent males , and " starship troopers " has the antiseptic retro-future look of late 50s/early 60s sci-fi .  the one cityscape shown is a jetsons-like gleaming metropolis , with flying cars whizzing past an obvious matte painting .  the hairstyles are retro too , straight from the frankie avalon , annette funicello school of fashion .  ultimately , verhoeven's motives are irrelevant .  he has produce a gargantuan film that fails as an action film or as a social satire .  it even fails to be an entertaining bad movie .  avoid " starship troopers " at all costs . 
pos@ pos neg for the first reel of girls town , you just can't get over lili taylor .  is it possible to remain unperturbed that a woman of this age is playing a high school student ?  harder still , can you avoid astonishment at how perfect she is in the part ?  with the sure , showy expertise of a de niro , taylor imbues unwed mother patti with all the faux fuck-you confidence she can muster .  it's a deeply felt , dead-on performance , and by the halfway point you've forgiven taylor her own maturity .  for all its verite pretenses , girls town is less about a bunch of high-schoolers than it is about a movie director and a cadre of writer-performers examining their own feelings about rape , relationships , and american womanhood .  the movie's opening scenes sketch an easy friendship between a group of four smart/sassy high school outsiders on the verge of graduation : patti , angela ( bruklin harris ) , emma ( anna grace ) , and nikki ( aunjanue ellis ) .  but about 10 minutes into the film , we get word that nikki has swallowed a fistful of pills and bowed out of life .  the remaining girls manage to smug nikki's diary out of her grieving mother's home , and page through it at patti's place , investigating the root of nikki's despair .  what they find is cruel and galvanizing -- nikki had been raped by an editor at a newspaper where she interned , and was privately questioning the sanity and value of a world where such a thing could happen .  shell-shocked by the truth of the matter , the three girls begin to talk among themselves and come to a realization about their own lives .  emma says she was raped last year on a date with a football player .  patti's barely sympathetic , wondering what the hell emma thought she was doing with her shirt off in a jock's car .  and anyway , patti's had her own share of guys who wouldn't take no for an answer .  pained , acrimonious debate ensues as the trio grow more and more angry -- angry about the impossibility of saying no , and angry with themselves for being weak , for being naive , for putting up with it .   " why do we put up with it ? "  emma finally asks , once the argument has reached a fever pitch .   " we try to talk about it , and look what happens .  we fight for 20 minutes . "  there's the admirable crux of this picture .  girls town is a political film , in that it calls for action .  but it's incomplete-it's never quite sure how to justify that action , or what form it should take .  the trio become crusaders for their right to dignity , and it's surely one of this year's most stirring movie moments when emma lobs a concrete block through the passenger-side window of that damn jock's car ( doing the right thing ? ) .  they hang out in the bathroom , chatting incessantly and scrawling slogans and naming names on the door to a toilet stall .   " subvert the patriarchy , " emma writes , and then starts a hall of shame list underneath that other students begin to contribute to .  the girls silence their hecklers , take revenge on the deadbeat father of patti's child , and eventually come face-to-face with nikki's tormentor .  still , the movie has a desperately unfinished quality , and none of these subsequent exploits is particularly satisfying .   ( you keep waiting for someone to call the cops on these brazen girls , but nobody thinks of it . )  perhaps searching for a resolution missing from the material at hand , the film borrows its epigraphs from audre lorde and queen latifah ( " who you callin' a bitch ? " ) .  the points are well taken , but they should have been unnecessary .  long on characterization but a little short on story , girls town is less than it could have been , and too self-congratulatory for my own taste .  director jim mckay is best known as a consort of r . e . m . 's  michael stipe ( he directed the nearly unwatchable tourfilm for that band ) , and girls town is his first foray into feature filmmaking .  the movie was created and scripted by committee , but mckay and his lead performers had to shoot on a shoestring when , predictably , the group couldn't secure funding .  then again , girls town on a budget would hardly be the same film .  the movie's slapdash quality is key to its significance .  truth be told , all three of the leads look too wise for high school , but that's ok -- there's a once-removed quality to their fine , spontaneous performances , as the women take a very skillful look back at the girls they once were , the girls they wish they had been , or some combination .  for all its flaws , this one gets extra points for having its uncertain head and heart in the same noble place . 
neg@ pos neg an american werewolf in london is john landis' groundbreaking feature about an american tourist who gets himself bitten by a werewolf in jolly old england .  the groundbreaking part of the movie is the special effects .  more specifically , the makeup used for the transformation of a man into a werewolf ; and for the ghosts that haunt the main character .  even twenty years after its release , that part of the movie is still impressive .  although , i would have to say that it really is the only part of the movie that could be considered impressive .  the rest of the movie is a run of the mill werewolf flick with some extra gore thrown in for good measure .  if it weren't for the cutting edge makeup effects used in the werewolf transformation it is most likely that this is a film that would have gone largely unnoticed when it was released back in 1980 .  and with good reason -- the acting isn't great and neither is the writing .  well ok , we don't actually expect either of those things to be great in a horror film .  but one other important element is lacking here too -- it isn't scary .  with no exception , you know what is going to happen before it happens .  you don't even need the obligatory scary music to give you a hint .  i will give director john landis credit for this being one of the best looking horror films that i have ever seen .  but john , it just wasn't scary .  i didn't know if this was intended to be some sort of romantic drama and the whole werewolf thing was just thrown in to get people to come to the theater to see it , but it didn't work for me .  actually , it was intended as a sort of a spoof on horror films .  but the mix of the comedic moments with the melodrama was so bad ; the intended humor was lost on me .  it's never a good sign that you don't realize a movie is supposed to be funny until after the movie is long over and you read it in the background material .  call me crazy , but you shouldn't have to do research on a movie to enjoy it .  i'm not even going to get into the plot of the movie that much , since the title pretty well sums the whole thing up .  werewolf bites boy ( david naughton ) .  boy ends up in hospital where he is tended to and eventually falls for pretty nurse ( jenny agutter ) and then strange things begin to happen to boy .  including , and i must admit this is a very nice touch , visits from his friend who was killed in the same werewolf attack that ended up with him in the hospital .  the neat thing here is that his buddy is a rapidly deteriorating corpse .  i know it sounds strange , but it actually works .  the scenes between david naughton and the dead buddy ( griffin dunne ) are really the best parts of the movie .  as i said , probably the only reason that this film was a hit was because of the special effects .  while they are still impressive today , they aren't impressive enough , or plentiful enough to warrant watching this film .  and since they are more or less the highlight of the film , there are far better choices out there if you want a scary movie to curl up with your sweetheart to watch .  actually , the 1998 sequel , an american werewolf in paris , is more entertaining since it doesn't take itself as seriously and actually provides a few more laughs along the way . 
pos@ pos neg gothic murder-mystery yarns are not a new conceit .  in fact , they've been around in books and on film for many , many years .  without the proper handling , they come off as old-fashioned , bland , and outdated .   " the gift , " directed by sam raimi , is a tried-and-true effort that surprises very little , and includes everything from a wide array of suspects and red herrings , to mansions in the deep south with moss trees out front , to the eventual discovery of a waterlogged corpse found in a nearby pond .  it's fairly obvious who the killer is ; in fact , i predicted who it would be before the movie began and was correct in my preliminary suspicions .  the film ultimately shouldn't work , but it does , thanks to a sparkling cast that fills each character with so many memorable nuances , the most fun to be had is in simply watching the people interact with each other .  annie wilson ( cate blanchett ) is a recently widowed mother of three sons who makes her living giving psychic readings to the residents of her backwater southern hometown .  some of her mainstay clients include valerie barksdale ( hilary swank ) , who is severely abused by her husband donnie ( keanu reeves ) , and buddy cole ( giovanni ribisi ) , an unstable mechanic who is confused by the nightmares he's been having about a mysterious blue diamond that is somehow linked to his father .  for annie , she does not give the readings merely for money , but uses it as a way of seeking solace in finding the good in everyone's future .  her late grandmother ( rosemary harris ) told her as a child that it was a gift she was given , and she should always remember that .  when annie's eldest son is involved in a fight at school , she meets the nice-guy school principal , wayne collins ( greg kinnear ) , whom she finds herself attracted to .  but wayne is engaged to the wealthy jessica king ( katie holmes ) , whom annie immediately gets a negative vibe about .  at a party with her best friend linda ( kim dickens ) , annie stumbles upon jessica in a compromising position with lawyer david duncan ( gary cole ) .  soon after , jessica has disappeared , leaving everyone in a frenzy over what could have possibly happened to her , and annie starts to have nightmares and apparitions linking jessica with the vicious redneck donnie barksdale , and the pond behind his home .   " the gift " may be cliched on a sheer storytelling level , but the performances and tight direction from raimi ( who has redeemed himself for his embarrassing last film , 1999's " for love of the game " ) lift the picture up several notches .  slowly enveloping the viewer into the many intriguing characters and their individual plights , the disappearance of jessica at the 30-minute mark divulges the movie's true intentions and transforms the proceedings into a taut , at times frightening , horror-mystery .  at the center of the film is the exceptional cate blanchett ( 1999's " the talented mr . ripley " ) , who turns annie wilson from what could have been little more than a run-of-the-mill protagonist into a very exact , down-to-earth , realistic person with valid troubles and a caring attitude towards those around her .  blanchett takes the unextraordinary material and runs with it , giving the entire film a truly classy aura that it otherwise might not have had .  we follow her at every turn because she is so mesmerizing , both as a character and an actress .  blanchett isn't the only bright performer , as she is ably supported by one of the best casts of the year .  in her first role following her oscar win for 1999's " boys don't cry , " hilary swank is excellent as the confused valerie , who seeks guidance from annie , but is too scared to take her biggest advice of all : to leave the grossly abusive donnie .  as donnie , keanu reeves ( 2000's " the watcher " ) makes an utterly convincing backwoods meanie , so much so that it is difficult to believe he is an actor at all .  for the often-criticized reeves , whose acting abilities have never been the best , this is the biggest compliment he could possibly get , and it is also one of the better performances he has given .  giovanni ribisi ( 2000's " the boiler room " ) is heartbreaking as a mentally slow young man who sees annie as his only friend , and wants her to do nothing but help him understand why he is being plagued by bad dreams about his dad .  in the small , but pivotal role of the sleazy jessica king , katie holmes ( 2000's " wonder boys " ) has turned in yet another stunning supporting turn .  her promiscuous role of jessica is one she has never played before , and she is radiant in her few scenes .  finally , kim dickens ( 2000's " hollow man " ) makes her usual strong impression as annie's spicy best friend , linda .  the other notable aspect of " the gift " is its moody atmosphere that lays such a thickly foreboding air over every scene it's almost suffocating .  thanks to cleverly construed editing by arthur coburn and bob murawski , and the successful use of different eerie sounds effects and a very good music score by christopher young , the movie not only achieves a scary undercurrent , but one that is filled with dread .  helped along by a strong screenplay by billy bob thornton and tom epperson , which makes the most of its setting and delightful cast , " the gift " is that rarest of thrillers that actually thrills , and offers up a fair share of chills , too .  it may not be groundbreakingly original , but it sure is an entertaining ride for the duration of its running time .

( i'm paraphrasing ) " type of exchange is used at least four times in the opening ten minutes of the film , each time getting progressively less funny .  what they should have stolen were the background sight gags which were so effective in the zucker brother's films while writing their own dialogue .  director rick friedberg focuses more on the mug shots of his actors ( especially nielsen , who can do this quite well ) than on the delivery and context of their lines , much of the time cutting the punchline short .  the whole film seems to be in a race with itself to be over , as is evident in the final sequence , where there is no comedic denouement after the climax .  as was usual in the zucker brothers films and in spy hard , the end credits tend to replace this by being out of context .  one of the more amusing was , " captain of the enterprise . . . . . . james  t . kirk " .  overall , i thought this was a very weak effort .  while all of the right films to spoof were chosen , they used none of the right spoofing methods .  next time they should " spy " a little bit harder .   * * * * = excellent .  one of a kind .  must see .   * * * = entertaining .  worth the price of admission .   * * = fair .  nothing much special .   * = what were they thinking ? ? 
pos@ pos neg expand the final fifteen minutes of home alone into a feature-length film and you've got baby's day out--an agreeably amusing children's comedy about a bumbling band of kid kidnappers who are unwittingly outwitted by an innocent infant .  the plot tracks a trio of crooks-posed-as-photographers ( mantegna , pantoliano , haley ) who steal nine-month-old bennington august cottwell iv , aka baby bink , from his old-money home .  but the plan goes awry when baby crawls out an open window and into the streets of downtown chicago !  following the path of his favorite story , called " baby's day out , " baby rides a bus and visits the zoo and winds up at a skyscraper construction site .  while baby stays unscathed , the crooks fare worse for the wear .  the stooges get hit by boards and dropped from roofs and , of course , suffer multiple crotch injuries .

neg@ pos neg among multitude of erotic thrillers , that had been released in the early 1990s , woman of desire is interesting only because it was directed by robert ginty , star of the b-grade action films of the previous decade .  those who tend not to be nostalgic about 1980s can find very good reason in the type of movies that made ginty the star .  as director , ginty did very little to improve that impression .  the protagonist of the movie is jack ( played by jeff fahey ) , yacht skipper that falls madly in love with christina ford ( played by bo derek ) .  however , she has relationship with rich and powerful jonathan ashby ( steven bauer ) .  one stormy night , the tragedy occurs and jack is accused of rape and murder .  however , his good friend walter j . hill ( robert mitchum ) happens to be very good lawyer , so jack might even prove his innocence in the end .  belonging more to the genre of courtroom drama than erotic thriller , woman of desire distinguishes itself from similar films by having almost all characters behaving like total idiots .  unfortunately , this film isn't comedy and any laugh is unintentional .  the characters are totally antipathetic and irritating and soon we stop caring what would happen to them .  the actors that play them don't help either .  that is especially the case with jeff fahey , whose jack is so stupid that even the character played by fahey in lawnmower man looks like a genius in comparison .  his partner bo derek , on the other hand , shows that she didn't age enough to cease being the sex goddess , but that is small compensation for her apparent lack of acting talents .  ginty , on the other hand , tries to bring some life in the movie by using many flashbacks and strange angles of shooting , but in the end it gets only irritating to the already bored and dissatisfied viewer . 
pos@ pos neg  " you'll go ape over tarzan because it's more fun than a barrel of monkeys ! "  okay , there's the quote in case disney wants to put something in their ads for the movie .  disney's latest animated feature throws us right into the action from the very beginning , skipping the usual main title sequence and putting us on pitching waves as a small family attempts to escape from a sinking ship .  father , mother , and infant somehow make it to shore amidst a rousing song by phil collins , and have soon built a treehouse which would impress the swiss family robinson .  it's amazing , the kinds of things you can do when you work to a soundtrack .  before you know it , an unfortunate set of circumstances put the baby in the hands of kala ( glenn close ) , a mother ape who recently lost her own baby to a predatory leopard .  against the wishes of her mate and family leader , kerchak ( lance henricksen ) , she takes on the infant boy as her own .  tarzan is not so much a story about a human boy surviving in the african jungles as it is about one who does not really fit in either humanity or the wild .  much of tarzan's young life is spent trying to become one of the apes in the eyes of his peers and his " father , " which occasionally gets him into trouble no matter how well-meant his attempts .  all he's looking for is acceptance , perhaps a goal easily identifiable by young viewers , but one which will ring true with a lot of adults .  when you really think about it , this story fits right into the disney formula of the outcast that triumphs in the end .  look back on past disney animated features and you'll see the trend .  growing up , tarzan ( voiced by alex d . linz as a child , and by tony goldwyn as an adult ) has a couple of friends .  one is an ape named terk ( rosie o'donnell ) , and the other is a paranoid hypochondriac of an elephant named tantor ( wayne knight ) .  both provide the requisite comic relief ( timon and poombah from the lion king immediately come to mind ) and perform the usual hijinks as prescribed by the disney mold .  i'm beginning to think anyone can write the screenplay for one of these films .  just fill in the blanks !  can you see it ?   " now we have to have a couple of zany friends for out hero who might get him into mischief , but cover for him or come to his rescue when he needs it .  we've already had a fish and a crab , and we've had a candle and a teapot , a genie and a dog , a few stone statues . . . . have  we had an ape and an elephant yet ?  well , there we go ! "  of course , there's gotta be romance somewhere along the line , so jane ( minnie driver ) gets introduced about halfway through .  together with her father dr . porter ( nigel hawthorne ) and the big game hunter clayton ( brian blessed ) , jane is on an expedition to find and study the wild gorillas of africa .  she discovers the man raised by apes and is enchanted almost immediately , and soon shares an amusing version of the compulsory " you tarzan , me jane " scene .  thankfully , those aren't the exact words .  however , i found it distracting that tarzan is going " ohh ohh ee ee " one second and then tells jane his name in this manly voice with perfect diction .  how does he tell his name to another ape ?   " ohh ohh ee - tarzan - ee ee ohh ? "  well , regardless of my picky nature , the romance actually works as only disney romance can : purely contrived , but for some reason rather believable .  but hey , tarzan's a young adult .  do you think he dated a few of the female apes before meeting jane ?  isn't that illegal in most countries ?  oh , well .  i don't think disney will be using my quote anymore .  tarzan departs from the usual disney feature in that this one is not a musical .  there's lots of music to be sure , but not a single character song in the whole hour and a half of running time .  we instead get more of a phil collins concert , as no less than five of his original songs are used as interlude material .  this isn't really a bad thing , as the songs are very high-energy and catchy ( i found myself singing one to myself for most of the following day ) ; it's just different .  do yourself a favor and see this film in a theater with a good sound system , because the music will come through astonishingly well and really enhance the movie .  with each new feature , disney animation gets even better .  not necessarily by leaps and bounds , but since they put out a new film each year , a steady rate of improvement is apparent , and this definitely shows in tarzan .  there are a couple of scenes where the animation achieves a near 3-d effect , and a number of scenes which feature tarzan moving through the trees are absolutely dizzying .  the way he slides down tree limbs and trunks is very reminiscent of skateboarding and rollerblading maneuvers , and had me thinking this isn't just tarzan , it's " extreme tarzan . "  however , tarzan does not seem to have what i call its " chandelier scene , " which is the one scene to which the animators have chosen to devote an inordinate amount of effort , utilizing a computer-assisted process that makes the animation absolutely breathtaking .  lasting but a few seconds at most , it's been the signature of nearly every disney animated feature since beauty and the beast , in which the castle ballroom chandelier was rendered in stunning detail .  as usual , the voice talent is up to snuff , convincingly make you believe in the convictions of animated characters .  the one poor choice in casting , however , was rosie o'donnell .  going into the film , i didn't know she was even a part of it , but when terk started talking , i recognized her voice immediately .  her performance was fine , but through the rest of the film i kept thinking , " that's no boy ape , that rosie o'donnell . "  distracting to say the least .  i'll admit i've never read the edgar rice burroughs story " tarzan of the apes , " so i couldn't tell you how true this film stays to the book .  but unless you're a purist , you should have few objections to this film .  with solid performances , action , adventure , a bit of romance , and great music and animation , tarzan should appeal to the kids and to the kid in all of us .  note : when i wrote my review of mulan a year ago , i went off on the promotional and merchandising tie-ins prevalent with the release of a disney animated feature .  this time , i'll just say that i went to mcdonald's yesterday to treat myself to a mcflurry , and tarzan was on the cup .  'nuff said . 
neg@ pos neg numerous comparisons can be made with this movie to past sci-fi , suspense thrillers .  soldier is a multi ? crossbreed between the likes of terminator , aliens and offspring .  the problem with such mixed genes is that the final product is a real mongrel ? not well made and should have been put down before production got off the ground .  besides this , the action is mediocre when compared to the standard action flicks of this day and age .  the fight scenes between jason scott lee and kurt russell seem laboured , slow and sluggish , and could have done with better choreography .  russell who is usually a good actor in b-grade action flicks is unusually hampered by his character ? sergeant todd , who seems more like a sergeant toad .  besides having almost no dialogue , his character appears stunted , zombie-like which is in line with his screen persona , but scores little points of empathy with the audience .  this movie has not made me change my opinion about director paul anderson , whose last epic event horizon has left an unusually bitter taste in my mouth .  although this movie does not come anywhere close to the strangeness of former , it is still a long way from anything considered desirable . 
pos@ pos neg capsule : suprisingly more of a comedy than a straight action flick , which isn't necessarily a bad thing .  not exactly oscar caliber , but one helluva bullet-riddled good time .  extended review : you know , i remember when hitmen were evil , murderous scum .  alas , the times are a-changin' .  in a recent string of movies , hitmen are suddenly wise- cracking , fun-loving killers-with-hearts .  this brings us to hong kong director kirk wong's first american feature , the big hit .  oddly enough , about the same time last year a similar film , grosse point blank , was released .  advertised as a quirky comedy with hints of action , it turned out to have a suprising dosage of it .  the big hit is quite the opposite .  it was hyped as " the new film from producer john woo " , so one would it expect lots of stylized killing and action .  however , there's a sore lack of it , which is about the only thing wrong with the big hit .  the film starts out with mel smiley and his cohorts doing a job on a white slaver .  mel , played by mark wahlberg in a dopey , milquetoast role , is a killing machine ; he flips , spins , even breakdances whilst popping caps .  sadly , he doesn't get a chance to do much of it .  except for the beginning set piece and the last 20 twenty minutes or so , the film is in comedy mode .  the action , at least what there is of it , is prime cut stuff .  wong , after numerous hong kong features , makes quite a nice u . s . debut .  however , his pacing is a bit off , with the action sequences only bookending the movie and not lasting long enough .  they start off electrifying and fresh , but just kinda stop .  normally , this would hamper a movie to the point of being unenjoyable .  luckily , we have ben ramsey's screenplay , a bitingly funny piece of work .  the only problem is there might be too much humor , one joke makes you laugh so hard you miss the next few .  some of best gags include an oriental film maker down on his luck and one of mel's hitmen pals that has just discovered onanism .  the only problem is how some of the minor characters are handled , some being there only for a laugh , which sometimes works , sometimes doesn't .  overall , the big hit may have it's flaws , but it makes up for them in a stylishly directed , gut-wrenchingly funny joyride .  definately one of the better ways to spend two hours . 
neg@ pos neg  ( dreamworks skg ) running time : 2 hours starring robert duvall , tea leoni and elijah wood directed by mimi leder the first of the two asteroid movies coming out this year ( the second is the macho armageddon ) is actually a dull affair .  elijah wood plays leo biederman , who during astronomy class discovers that a large asteroid is heading for earth .  tea leoni plays a ( rather crap ) news reporter , jenny lerner , who soon discovers about this asteroid through a very long winded and boring way , and robert duvall plays the leader of a space crew , spurgeon tanner , who are planning to blow the asteroid out of the path of earth .  also featuring is morgan freeman as the president , and maximilian schell and vanessa redgrave as jenny's father and mother .  while many people will walk into the film expecting a big special effects fest with the asteroid blowing everything up ( as the trailers seem to promise ) , the film is actually more of a character study , if a very poor one .  the main problem is that there are too many characters in the film , and not enough time to explore them all .  only the space crew are given any depth , jenny lerner , leo and the president are surprisingly 2d , and we never get to know these characters .  and because i couldn't care for them , i didn't really give a crap if the asteroid killed them or not .  the script by bruce joel rubin and michael tolkin is horribly simple , and never really makes any interesting statements .  mimi leder , the former er director and director of the average the peacemaker ( 1996 ) , again directs in a ho-hum style , and never really gets any emotion out of a scene , which is a shame .  the cast are seemingly on autopilot , although tea leoni does gives a rather good performance , even if she acts a bit too dorky for her own good .  she seems uncommonly stupid for a journalist .  robert duvall is on autopilot with a underwritten role , he just seems to be in this film for the money .  elijah wood , one of the best child actors working today , is surprisingly average , although his choice of roles lately haven't exactly been brilliant ( i . e .  flipper , 1996 ) .  his role is also vastly underwritten .  morgan freeman , again , is utterly wasted with a ridiculously underwritten role .  like duvall , he just seems to be in the film for the money .  the supporting cast are all o . k , none making much of an impression .  ok , so deep impact may have messed up character wise , but surely the special effects are good ?  well , yes and no .  although the special effects should be impressive , with a massive tidal wave destroying new york , the special effects look like , well , special effects .  sadly , the waves looks like it's been drawn on computer , and doesn't look too good at all .  surprising really , when the effects are done by industrial light & magic , who did the effects for the lost world and twister .  in the end , deep impact is a wasted opportunity .  what could of been a moving movie with good effects turns out to be a dud in both characters and effects .  the 2 hours the film had could have been used to much greater effect .  once again , dreamworks has churned out another average movie .  let's hope armageddon is a bit better .  overall rating= review by david wilcock web space provided by geocities 
pos@ pos neg no matter what you suspect , this isn't your usual action thriller .  the usual suspects is an intelligent crime mystery story from up-and-coming director bryan singer .  it's one of those movies that , after everything is revealed rapid-fire at the end , you immediately want to rewind and watch again because earlier scenes take on a new light .  plot twists a-go-go are what you get here -- i gave up trying to figure out the mystery of keyser soze after awhile and just sat back and waited for them to reveal it to me .  keyser soze is a name you'll hear at least a hundred times if you watch the usual suspects and for good reason .  it's not only the name of the mysterious ( and possibly even mythical ) crime boss in the movie , it also sums up the movie -- " keyser soze " in latin means " an intelligent crime mystery story from up-and-coming director bryan singer . "  or maybe i shouldn't have bought a foreign-language dictionary from the same company that makes those 99-cent encyclopedias sold in supermarkets .  at the movie's opening , a group of known criminals are brought in for a police lineup , including mcmanus ( stephen baldwin ) , keaton ( gabriel byrne ) , fenster ( benicio del toro ) , buckney ( kevin pollack ) and verbal ( kevin spacey , winner of the best supporting actor academy award{symbol 153 \ f " times new roman " \ s 10 \ h} for his performance in the movie ) .  verbal is so-named because he frequently rambles on about anything or nothing .  he also earns his name as the movie's narrator , spouting memorable lines like " the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist " ( although , obviously , he does exist -- what else could explain kris kross having a comeback in 1996 ? ) while being interrogated by police detective chazz palminteri ( any actor with multiple z's in their name is okay in my book ) .  we see the story unfold as spacey retells it .  the five felons , upon being released from the lineup , get their revenge on the police by exposing a corrupt taxi service -- whereby elite criminals pay to be smuggled through town in cop cars -- and stealing all the money and drugs in the car .  it's a definite case of male bonding for the five criminals , who later find out they were brought together by the unseen keyser soze , who sends a minion to them with an offer they can't refuse .  namely , they have to destroy soze's main competitors in organized crime by infiltrating a ship , shooting a bunch of people , burning all the drugs and stealing $91 million cash .  spacey does a terrific job of bringing his seemingly unintelligent " cripple " character to life and baldwin , byrne , palminteri and the rest make for a good supporting cast .  the usual suspects is one of those movies that deftly mixes scenes of violence and explosions with an underlying sense of mystery and suspense , keeping the viewer guessing until the very end -- and then still leaving a few details open for scrutiny and discussion .  i suppose all that would be cleared up if i really had rewound the movie and watched it again instead of changing the channel and wondering in disbelief what the hell kris kross was doing on mtv .  a different mystery , i guess , which may turn into a _murder_ mystery if that video ever comes on again . . . 
neg@ pos neg  " ladybugs " is a typical comedy that relies on three supposed guarantees : the pathetic team who beats the champs ; cross dressing ; and the presence of rodney dangerfield .  this picture doesn't play like a comedy for children , so who is it aimed at ?  and why is it told like a 91-minute sit-com instead of a feature film ?  rodney dangerfield stars as chester lee , a total schmuck working at a huge corporation .  he obviously doesn't have a lot of self esteem and thinks he has to kiss up to get ahead , which he does by volunteering to coach the company's girls' soccer team .  what a shock to learn chester and his assistant julie ( jackee ) know absolutely nothing about the game , and the players seem to know even less .  i didn't laugh , but for some reason it didn't annoy me that much .  chester's fiancee bess ( graff ) thinks he got a promotion in addition to the coaching position , and of course she has a slacker for a son who is doing poorly in school and is kicked off the sports teams .  jonathon brandis is a nice surprise as matthew , who agrees to dress up as a girl named martha to help out chester ( probably because the girl he has a crush on plays on the team - what original story ideas ! ) .  what we get is just another retread of the " underdog sports team " mixed with some cross dressing .  unfortunately , the film isn't smart enough to play upon the drag aspect .  in fact , it downplays it so heavily it's totally unbelievable .  could it be any more obvious martha is a boy ?  he only wears a girl's wig , without any makeup , and they don't even give him falsies .  brandis doesn't bother to mimic a girl's voice either .  then there is a pointless scene where chester and matthew shop for a dress , but for what reason ?  martha is only seen on the soccer field , why would they buy a dress for her ?  just when we think the martha character is going to be useful , she disappears , and the story wanders aimlessly looking for a new plot to pick up on .  when bess discovers what's really going on she breaks up with chester , and the relationship is forgotten about and the film focuses on the soccer team and the tension between chester and his boss .  this film could've been less bad had it been the cliche sports comedy , but it feels the need to go off on tangents that are completely unnecessary ( and bad at that ) .  there's just too much of a sit-com feel here , especially during the so-called serious moments , and all the confusion between the characters .  i've seen worse movies than " ladybugs , " but for some reason it contained some sort of bizarre charm , so even when it turns sour it doesn't seem as bad as it is .  dangerfield finally gets his respect in the end , but at what a price . 
pos@ pos neg i'm an avid fan of the " alien " saga , so this review is obviously a tad biased ( at least i admitted it ) .  of course , that doesn't mean that i'm gonna be giving this a four-star review or something , because " alien : resurrection , " the fourth film in the cool-as-hell series is not an absolutely amazing film , much like the first two were .  however , it's a very good film which never fails to entertain , and consists of yet another mutation in the style of the series .  in short , i had a good time .   " alien : resurrection " leaves off 200 years after the last one , where our heroine protagonist , ellen ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , the science fiction genre's answer to job , had killed herself after discovering that an alien was inside her body , waiting to pop out like it did to john hurt in the first one .  of course , the last one wasn't very great or anything ( i liked it , though not as much as the first two ) , and more importantly , it wasn't financially successful ( a tawdry 55 million bucks ! ) .  so back we are , with ripley back as a clone , which means we get another little satirical look at cloning ( not that that's a bad thing , but it's becoming a cliche ) .  so she's cloned aboard an even more futuristic-looking ship called " the auriga " by some doctors ( including the necessary bad government guy , dr . wren , played by j . e . freeman , as well as the little-seen dr . gediman , played by none other than brad douriff ) , mainly because they have a version of her with the alien still inside her .  once you get past the fact that you can't figure out where they got her blood ( although i think it might have been from the blood samples taken by charles dance in the third one ) , the film's okay .  also on board are a band of mercenary pirates , including michael wincott , ron perlman , kim flowers , raymond cruz , dominique pinon ( a jeunet sytable ) and . . . winona ryder , who plays analee call , who turns out to have a bit of a secret ( i won't state it , but unless you've been shacking up with salinger for the past two years , you probably know all about it - although it's nicely covered up ) .  there's a bit of a non-sexual-yet-slightly-homoerotic relationship between her and ripley , but it's never really deepened enough .  oh well .  well , as you might have guessed , the alien and its spawn escape and run around the ship .  and it pretty much does away with most of the people on the ship ( including some shocks - dan hedaya , for instance , who's death is comical yet sad since , well , he's dan hedaya ) , and the remaining people ( about 7 or 8 ) are left to try and escape and stop the aliens from doing any major harm since the ship is heading quickly towards earth .  of course , the plot is all balderdash , and just an excuse for some good old " alien " -brand fun .  the real focus of the series seems to be on style , not really substance ( although there's always a bit of it , most notably in " aliens " with the relationship between ripley and the little girl ) .  what's interesting about the series is that each film is stylistically different in its approach .   " alien " is a claustrophobic exercise in quiet frights .   " aliens " is a wild , tense thriller .   " alien 3 " is a bleak , moody piece of semi-noir .   " alien 4 " is kind of like an off-beat french film , filled with lots of humor , and cool scares .  jean-pierre jeunet ( without his usual directing partner , marc caro ) creates a ship filled with the kind of scares films like " das boot " has , with echoes hinting at a possible threat .  the chills in the film are really cool , especially with the music , which is sometimes turned down completely for certain scenes ( there's the most tense surgery scene since " face/off " towards the beginning ) .  and not every chill turns into a bloody mess or anything like that .  this all combined with some good old humor makes this as interesting visually and stylistically as the others .  there are even a couple scenes which just stick out afterwards as being brilliantly executed .  one is the aforementioned surgery scene .  another one takes place between call and ripley , which is just awesome .  the underwater chase scene and the ladder scene afterwards is one of the most tense , thrilling , and jaw-dropping scenes in the entire saga ( with a small allusion to jeunet's earlier film , " delicatessen " ) .  and the way they do in the final alien is hysterically cool ( with a lovely allusion to " goldfinger " ) .  but the best scene in the entire film ( i'm sure i'm not the first to mention it ) takes place when ripley sees all the variations on her as they cloned her ( she has a an " 8 " tatooed on her arm ) .  it might be the most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire saga .  the screenplay by joss whedon is not a great piece of work , as it never really deapens a lot of the characters .  however , it does make us care about most of them , so that when there's very little of them , and it looks like one or more of them may become alien chow , we are pretty scared .  and , yeah , there are some very funny lines ( ripley : " who do i have to fuck to get off this boat ? !

neg@ pos neg every now and then , reviewers are faced with the films that are hard to be properly reviewed .  most of the time it happens with films that leave so overwhelming impact , either good or bad , that in the end reviewers must work hard to express his thoughts or feelings .  but , sometimes it can happen for rather trivial reasons .  i love trouble happened to be one of such occasions for the author of this review .  the impression left by the film wasn't overwhelming - on the contrary , there were hardly any impression at all , since i had real trouble keeping myself awake while watching it .  which surprise me to this day , because the movie theatre was full , i was close to sound speakers , the show wasn't late and i didn't lack sleep before the show .  such things happen very rarely to me , and , after many years , the closest thing to solution to this mystery is probably the quality of the film itself .  the plot revolves around two rival chicago reporters - old peter brackett ( nick nolte ) and young , aspiring sabrina peterson ( julia roberts ) .  two of them are assigned to cover the train collision .  as soon as they meet , they start scooping each other , but during the process they both discover sinister plot involving cancerogenic milk , and also the romantic feelings they have for each other .  the plot in this film is rather secondary to its real raison d' ? tre - romantic pairing reminiscent of classical screwball comedies starring spencer tracy and katharine hepburn .  movie author , director and screenwriter charles shyer , who had some experiences with turning the screwball spirit into modern setting with father of the bride , tries again , this time pairing old nick nolte with young julia roberts .  however , although there is some chemistry between the two , soon it stops to arouse any interest .  it probably happens due to poorly executed genre mix , that collides light-hearted romantic comedy with rather uninteresting plot suitable to pure action thrillers .  shyer as director fails to make the proper transition between the two , and fails in both areas , making the story cliched and predictable .  the end result is rather forgettable effort , which convinced me not to watch movie again .  i'll give it the benefit of the doubt , though . 
pos@ pos neg anastasia contains something that has been lacking from all of the recent disney releases . . .   ( especially hercules ) . . .  emotion .  all the wacky characters voiced by celebrities and fantastically animated adventure sequences aren't going to hold anyone's interest unless there is an emotional core to hold it all together .  not since disney's beauty & the beast has there been such a compelling animated film with interesting characters and drama that works .  the story of the romanov family , the rulers of russia , and their downfall begins the film .  anastasia , one of the daughters , narrowly escapes the mad monk rasputin ( voiced by christopher lloyd ) with her grandmother ( voiced by angela landsbury ) .  but anastasia gets lost , and grows up with no memory of her royal origins .  the grandmother lives in paris , hoping to someday find her beloved anastasia , the only member of the family to survive the russian revolution .  a young woman named anya ( voiced by meg ryan ) runs across dimitri ( john cusack ) and vlad ( kelsey grammar ) , who are trying to put together a scheme to create an anastasia to fool the grandmother and get the reward money .  they pick anya to pose as their princes , and of course , it is soon revealed that anya is in fact the lost anastasia .  dimitri realizes that he can never win her love as he is a commoner , and meanwhile , rasputin is not dead , and plots his revenge against the last romanov .  the plot is actually quite well structured .  there are a lot of complexities that may have to be explained to the kids later , but it moves along fast enough that they'll never have time to be bored .  what this really means is that the adults won't be bored by it either .  there is a great deal of banter between anya and dimitri that is very funny , and their relationship develops quite naturally as the film progresses .  there is , of course , lots of comedy for the kids , including rasputin's pet bat , bartok ( hank azaria ) , who is easily the funniest thing in the film .  however , the comical scenes never distract from the drama , but are worked into the plot almost seamlessly .  the animation is gorgeous - the characters seem to come to life through the talented animators .  not since beauty & the beast have animated characters had so much life to them .  even without the voices , they act .  the musical number in paris is a show-stopper , with some of the backgrounds rendered in an impressionist painting style .  as with all recent animated features , there are songs , however , these songs do more than just provide fodder for top-40 singers to get on the radio ( although there are three of them during the end credits ) .  the songs are all very catchy , and advance the plot , instead of just being showpieces ( except for the paris number , but that's so much fun , it's okay . . . ) .  i can't reccomend anastasia highly enough .  it's a wonderful film that ranks right up there with other animated classics .  kids and adults alike will enjoy it , and it's also nice to have a quality animated feature film from another studio besides disney . 
neg@ pos neg there was probably a good reason that the warner bros . studio chose not to allow critics to view this steven seagal film when it first opened .  and , after seeing this piece of toxic waste , i now know why .  this movie is by far the worst offering that has hit the screen since possibly those ernest movies years ago .  fire down below centers its story on a little mining town in god's country , somewhere in eastern kentucky .  it's beauty and natural goodness is being slowly destroyed by an uncaring mining magnate ( kris kristopherson , who constantly looks like he wants to kill his agent for getting him this role ) .  it turns out that he's filling the mines throughout kentucky with toxic waste for a tidy profit .  seagal plays jack taggert , an aikido-versed , fighting machine , who is an agent with the epa .  no . . . not the cia nor the fbi nor the nsa .  it's the environmental protection agency .  i had no idea that epa agents were trained to be killers !  taggert is sent to find the perpetrators and to bring them to justice .  written by someone named jeb , i could already envision the stereotypes of incestuous relationships , banjo-picking preachers , and dumb-as-nails rednecks .  but the script puts seagal right smack dab in the middle of all of these scenarios as he tries to discreetly fit in .  seagal's idea of a disguise is a long-length $1000 leather jacket .  but to get closer to the kinfolk , he will fix people's porches for free .  that's another great epa asset - teaching agents how to fix porches .  slow and plodding , this project is a total mess .  the sometimes allure of watching seagal is watching him outmaneuver enemies that outnumber and outgun him like in under seige .  here , his bravado basically turns into bullyness .  townsfolk who are foolish enough to challenge seagal are quickly subdued .  fight scenes are quick and senseless and offers no enjoyment value whatsoever .  and his soap box message wears thin within the first 15 minutes .  the most annoying moment comes when he barges into the middle of a sunday church ceremony , gets behind the pulpit , and beseeches the townsfolk to take control of their lives and to help clean up the environment .  but the epitome of how moralistically mushy this film gets happens when the person responsible for the toxic dumping , kristopherson , meets up with seagal .  kristopherson asks seagal how much it will take for him to go away .  seagal gallantly replies : " i'll leave when you take the poison from the streams and the earth . "  i was expecting patriotic music to start blasting and a show of fireworks in the background .  this is truly nothing more than a pompous showcase for seagal's righteousness and narcissistic arrogance .  seagal has been vanguard in trying to bring a new genre into the filmplace , that of the enviro-thriller ( on deadly ground ) .  however , the message will never come across through poorly developed vehicles like this .  still , i believe in preserving mother earth , so save your $5 and please donate it instead to some worthy environmentally conscious charity . 
pos@ pos neg in the grand scheme of mel gibson movies , payback was better than conspiracy theory , but not as good as braveheart or lethal weapon .  in other words , it's a decent couple of hours of entertainment , but 20 years from now if a they compile a list of mel gibson's greatest hits , payback probably won't be on it .  gibson plays a crook who gets double crossed by his partner after they heist a payroll .  mel's partner needed the money to pay off a mob debt .  so he puts a couple of bullets in mel , leaving him for dead , and goes on to pay off his creditors .  but , mel isn't dead ( it would be a real short movie if he was ) and he certainly isn't happy .  to make matters worse , he wants his money back and is willing to go to any lengths to accomplish this feat .  his ex partner has already used it to pay off the mobsters , so mel goes after the mob to get it back .  payback is often a very violent film .  to its credit , there are a few scenes that could have been very graphic , but the director ( i'm not sure which one -- more about that in a second ) made the choice to let the audience use their imagination instead of subjecting us to the usual gratuitous gore found in many films .  the film appears a bit disjointed in places , which is understandable considering producer / star gibson wasn't thrilled with how the film turned out and wanted parts of it re-shot .  when the director refused , another one was brought in to do the re-shoot .  so as a result while the final product is apparently better than the original ( although personally i would love to see the original version for comparisons sake ) it does get a bit of a choppy feel to it towards the end .  it's always tough to make a film where the main character is a villain , unless that person has some redeeming qualities .  in this case , gibson's character has few redeeming qualities .  but hey , its mel , so even when he is killing people in cold blood we are still rooting for him .  my guess is that if that you put some other johnny bananas actor in this role , the audience would not be quite as responsive .  gibson is gibson , whether he is playing a suicidal cop or a stone cold killer , he does a good job .  he almost guarantees that no matter what else happens in the rest of the movie at least the audience is going to get one good performance .  this time out mel is surrounded by a good supporting cast , including maria bello ( as his love interest ) , william devane and kris kristofferson ( as mod bosses ) .  the man who steals the show and unfortunately doesn't have a real big part is james coburn ( as yet another mobster ) .  if i had one big disappointment in this film , it would be that coburn didn't have a bigger role .  in the end , payback is a fairly solid action thriller , just not in quite the same league as some of mel gibson's other work . 
neg@ pos neg vampires starts out almost in the style of a spaghetti western with an attack on a small homestead in new mexico .  the house has a nest of vampires and jack crow ( james woods ) is leading a team of vampire hunters in to clean them out .  while the initial imagery is a little over-dramatic , it gives way to what is a fairly decent action sequence .  that is enough action to last us a while and we could , director john carpenter would let us , get to a story line .  but it is not very long and there is not much plot until the next big action scene .  then there is only a bit more of plot before the next action scene after that .  the plot is kept to a minimum and the interesting ideas in the plot really get the short end .  and that is something of a pity because the film , based on the book vampire$ by john steakley , gives us a myth for the origins of vampires and explains why vampires are so intertwined with religious imagery .  this could be an interesting departure from the standard vampire film , but carpenter decides to tell us about it rather than to show it .  what carpenter saves his serious screen time for a sequence of spectacular fights between hunters and vampires .  there is a lot of fighting and lots of gore .  anything intriguing is kept to a minimum to so it does not get in the way of pleasing the action film fans .  this has not always been carpenter's style .  his 1981 version of the thing has action but also challenges the viewer to do a little thinking about the film's central science fictional question .  jack crow heads a vampire swat team , cleaning up nests of vampires with high-tech spears and crossbows .  in the early part of the film his team is wiped out by a particularly mean vampire valek ( thomas ian griffith ) who has been tipped off to who crow is .  now crow team is gone and he is down to himself and his sidekick tony montoya ( daniel baldwin ) .  to make matters worse , he does not know the people on his own side , tony and his backers , he can trust .  meanwhile jack is sure the vampires are looking for something that must be hidden somewhere here in new mexico .  if this is sounding like a very tired police corruption plot with a few obvious substitutions , that's exactly what it is .  the same story looks just as well with two partner cops looking for a gang of hood who are themselves looking for a packet of heroin .  but carpenter goes against a familiar principle of film : show people , don't tell them .  just about everything in the plot other than the fights we are told about in the dialog and not shown .  fundamental questions in the plot like where does crow get his funding , why are the vampires in new mexico--what do they want and why do they want it , what is the connection of the vampires and the catholic church , how did crow come to be a vampire hunter and why devote his life to it ?  the answers to any of these questions could have been dramatized , but instead are revealed through dialog .  now if all this was not bad enough , carpenter misuses the james wood persona .  woods plays a particular sort of cool lowlife very well .  but carpenter leads off the film by having woods do some sergio-leone- style mythic posturing .  while his crew prepares for an attack he stands staring fixedly through shades at the house that will be his target .  woods does not work as a larger than life mythic hero .  that is not his style and it just does not work very well .  there are some simple things that carpenter should be looking for as director that he misses .  in one scene we are looking at a motel room with dead people on the floor .  one female corpse is on the floor in front of a chair so that there is about an inch of daylight between her and the chair .  as the actress breathes the gap widening and narrowing makes it obvious her arm is moving up and down .  one also wonders how the existence of vampires is kept secret .  these vampires do not maintain a low profile .  there are arguably logical flaws in the film .  there is some question in my mind whether carpenter has a consistent policy on what effect bullets have on vampires .  it would take some rationalization to explain why in some scenes sunlight has a dramatic effect on vampires , yet in a scene toward the end a vampire can walk under a burned roof that lets him be swept by beams of sunlight .  i suspect that the book on which this film was based was better thought out .  while i might recommend this film to an action audience i would say that what i look for in a vampire film vampires rates a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .  perhaps i will read the book . 
pos@ pos neg accepting his oscar as producer of this year's best picture winner , saul zaentz remarked that his cup runneth over .  one could almost say the same about his much-prized film .  rarely is the screen so overflowing with potent imagery , symbolism , ideas and metaphors , complex and literate storytelling , all possessed of an intelligence that invites -- even demands -- constant scrutiny , an acuity of perception and observation that must somehow yield the truth .  in short , the antithesis of all things hollywood .  yet this surfeit of signals is made to serve a rather pale and thinly realized love story whose emotional impact is as dry as a desert wind .  ralph fiennes is the title character , an amnesiac burn victim whose gradual return to memory , and particularly the memory of love , is the ostensible focus of the film .  but despite the use of numerous flashbacks to help put the pieces of this personal puzzle together , we never learn enough about the man to feel much empathy for him .  his emotional life before the story begins is an essential clue that remains withheld .  the same can easily be said for every other character in the film , of which there are too many .  juliette binoche's nurse comes as close as this film gets to an emotional heart .  at least we learn early on that she is scarred by the deaths of those close to her , and so we understand why she is eager to escape the company of her comrades in order to seek refuge in the convalescence of a mysterious , disfigured , dying stranger .  even this information is imparted so quickly and in such cursory fashion , however , that it verges on the comical .  with so many characters enjoying so little screen time , the film's 160 minutes can be taxing .  yet there is something so captivating about the sensibility behind the camera that i couldn't help but feel that greatness was in the air .  hints of it were everywhere -- in a man who hates ownership but wants desperately to possess his lover ; in ancient cave paintings of swimmers copied casually by a modern-day swimmer in the sahara ; in the way the shifting sands of time obliterate everything more completely than a world war .  there is enough latent meaning to supply college film students with paper topics for years .  but ultimately the emotional truths writer-director anthony minghella was grasping for were never revealed .  in the end , i was left with the impression that i had witnessed quite an oxymoron : a haunting bore .  bore is perhaps too strong a word .  but after drinking in the rich production values , the cup remains only slightly over half-full . 
neg@ pos neg  " the animal " is a marginally inspired comedy that only manages to lumber along , generating just enough momentum to keep it from stalling .  it's clunky and slow , like watching an 18-wheeler trying to accelerate up a hill .  there are certainly better things you can do with your time .  actually , if you've seen the trailer , then you already know the plot and have seen its funniest moments .  the story centers on bland marvin ( rob schneider ) , who is an evidence clerk at the local police department that yearns to be a real officer .  but he's afflicted with loser-itis .  dogs attack him , neighbors torment him , children bully him , and his co-workers ignore him .  truthfully , with his bad haircut ( seemingly modeled after weird al yankovic , little richard , and giant poodles ) and his unenthusiastic demeanor , we'd probably throw tomatoes at him just for fun .  this is actually bad because you can't like a character if you can't develop sympathy for him .  we never do , and it may be just as well that he drives off a cliff and plummets to the canyon floor .  however , marvin is found by an eccentric doctor ( michael caton ) who uses a radical and experimental procedure to save him , implanting our doofus with various animal parts and organs .  as a result , marvin develops heightened senses and increased agility and speed .  he can smell drugs hidden anywhere on a body , swim with the speed of a dolphin , and can run as fast as a cheetah .  imagine the comedic possibilities that arise from this operation .  with his enhanced abilities , he could now reap vengeance on all those who have shunned him .  however , the spirit of the film takes a raunchy turn , and instead , marvin spends most of his time trying to subdue or satiate his voracious appetite and his animalistic , sexual urges .  goats beware !  he also chases cats , urinates to mark his territory , or growls at his enemies .  what he should've done was stick his head in the sand like an ostrich .  equally tenuous is its other running joke , which involves one of his friends ( guy torry ) who constantly complains that everyone is treating him too nicely because he's black .   " it's reverse racism , " he declares as he blows smoke into the faces of strangers but none of them says anything .  this element doesn't work the first time it's mentioned , and it becomes increasingly trite with every recurrence .  you don't have to be as wise as an owl to realize that " the animal " is tame .  if there's any reason to see this film , it's to see colleen haskell who makes her big screen debut .  remember her ?  she was voted off in week 11 of the 13-week program , " survivor .

pos@ pos neg the sheer horrific audacity of the nazi plan to exterminate the jews of europe is almost incomprehensible .  people may make documentaries about it for another hundred years and still not understand the organized , methodical hatred .  five concentration camp survivors from the last days of world war ii tell their stories in the last days , the first documentary from steven spielberg's survivors of the shoah visual history foundation .  the five interviewees are linked by their hungarian ancestry .  as the introduction explains , even as germany started to lose the war , the nazis stepped up their extermination of the jews in europe .  in 1944 , hungary had the last big population of jews within germany's reach , and they became the last target of hitler's " final solution . "  each of the five tells his or her story .  their stories are intercut chronologically , starting from normal life in pre-war hungary .  they recall the nazi invasion of hungary , being sent to " work " camps and their realization that they were actually in death camps .  they recall their horrible , precarious lives in auschwitz and buchenwald ; the deaths of their family and friends ; their loss of hope .  each recalls his or her unfathomable , eventual liberation .  and finally , the last days shows their cathartic , pained , modern-day return to their old homes and the camps .  needless to say , their stories are horrifying , amazing , and emotionally draining .  by themselves , the stories would be forceful testaments , but by cutting them in parallel , their impact is multiplied by five .  the last days is a talking-heads style documentary -- it's mostly pictures of people telling their stories , intercut with period photographs and newsreel footage .  in this kind of movie it's almost impossible to get archival pictures from the same time and place being discussed on-screen , but director james moll made a better effort than most at finding specific , or at least relevant , images to go with his subjects' narration .  the liner notes ( one of the many nice features of this dvd ) indicate that there is some never-before-seen historical footage in the last days .  it's not clear which scene it is .  it could be one of two that i hadn't seen before , both powerful .  one is rare color footage , shot by an american , of piles of victims in cattle cars .  there is something jarring , something unsettling about seeing the pictures in color , when so much of the footage from world war ii is in black and white .  another segment shows walking skeletons ; survivors who are so starved that they hardly look human anymore .  there has been a glut of holocaust movies and i was skeptical that a new documentary would have anything new to say .  but by focusing on hungarian jews during the last days of the war , moll told a specific part of the story in a new way , in greater detail .  and i'm glad he did because his careful filmmaking stands up well compared to other movies on the same subject .  the transfer to dvd is rich and beautiful .  x-mozilla-status : 0009f words for a holocaust documentary , but some of the interviews take place in europe in late spring , when skies are blue and trees are green .  also , the movie was shot on 35mm film ( and not video ! ) ,  so the richness and detail are impeccable .  the dvd's features are plentiful and well-chosen .  there is a theatrical trailer for the movie , which is a great introduction to the subject matter .  there are about fifty still photos , both from the production crew and from the private collections of the survivors .  also , the disc has two complete versions of the movie ( widescreen and full screen ) , both on the same side .  one of the more interesting dvd features is an outtake segment for each of the survivors ( plus one for the crew ) .  you'd think outtakes would be inappropriate in a holocaust documentary , but they're not bloopers .  instead , they are solid , moving segments that were probably cut from the film only for length .  one of them continues a confrontation that was only touched on lightly in the film .  renee firestone ( one of the five ) spoke on camera with dr . hans m ? nch , a german doctor who ran the medical clinic at auschwitz .  firestone was aggressive , questioning the doctor about what his children thought .  the doctor was evasive and clearly uncomfortable .  another of the outtakes showed bill basch saying a prayer for his dead friends at auschwitz .  he ends his prayer by saying " . . . forgive me for surviving . "  it's ambitious to shoot a documentary on 35mm film .  it's ambitious to make it on a subject that has saturated cable , television , and movies .  it's ambitious to make it 54 years after the events it covers .  but the last days handles all these potential obstacles very well .  it's only fitting that the dvd , with its wealth of interesting and relevant features , would also be ambitious and successful .

" ) is that russian troops are only miles away from jakob's ghetto .  liberation ! he thinks .  the next day , jakob tells the news to his closest friend , a volatile prize fighter named misha ( liev schreiber ) , who despite being sworn to secrecy passes the message along .  soon , it is a common assumption in the ghetto that jakob has a radio hidden in his home -- a crime punishable by death .  this is absurdly false , but the more jakob tells the people of the ghetto this , the more convinced they become that he is abreast of the latest developments in the war that is to decide their fate .  the danger , of course , is that the germans allegedly have informants throughout the ghetto , and rumors about the radio can get out and put jakob in great danger .  in a curiously irrelevant subplot , jakob finds a 11-year old girl who has separated from her parents and decides to hide her in his small home .  apparently he is afraid that she will be discovered , and goes to great length to make sure of that -- just why the idea frightens him is never made clear .  he and the girl build an uninvolving , generic relationship that never goes anywhere and is as irrelevant at the end as it was in the beginning .  the moral of the story is that hope is the best medicine .  but jakob the liar forgets that the hope that jakob brings to his ghetto is false .  such hope inevitably leads to expectations of its realization and when those expectations aren't met , the results are far worse than if there was no hope .  that's the film's biggest detriment : it is based on a false assumption and thus comes off as painfully false .  it's never moving because it doesn't give us anything to be moved by .  jakob the liar fails to tug any heartstrings which destroys its purpose for existing .  robin williams doesn't inject the film with life , as a matter of fact , he seems a little out of it , as if crippled by his fake accent .  he is stragely unenthusiastic ; his character is one who spreads hope but his performance is lifeless , hopeless .  not since good will hunting has he abandoned his signature style to this extent ; this isn't the robin williams we know and love .  in good will hunting he became a serious actor and won an oscar for it .  here , he is more of a wannabe serious actor ; an impostor .  jakob the liar will be compared with last year's life is beautiful because it is being marketed as a " holocaust comedy " .  it's not a comedy .  it tries , sometimes , but it rarely works .  is it a melodrama ?  a war movie ?  a character study ?  no , no , and no .  jakob the liar is the kind of movie that can't be placed into a category ; not because it covers so many different genres but because it fails at just about every one it attempts .

" )  only after we've spent twenty minutes or so with these characters do we learn that they have a sordid history together ; this angle , though apparently present to develop their characters , is never explored .  not that it really matters , since the characters consistently do ludicrous things for no other reason than to drive the plot .  in one scene , sunderland is attacked by a man in a mask .  she sees one of his rings , and she and brenner find the man later that day based on the ring .  instead of questioning him like as they would a real suspect , they take him to brenner's houseboat , beat him up , and pour hot coffee in his lap .  this scene really pushed me over the edge , not because it's gratuitous and mean-spirited , but because it illustrates the film's complete disregard for the characters and the audience .  it was impossible for me to feel anything for these people beyond this scene , mostly because nothing they do comes as a surprise .  i realized that these constructs on screen aren't actually characters , but devices present only to serve the story .  this would have been bad enough without the west's need to hose his movie down in tasteless images of rape and sexual misconduct .  compelling films about sexual crimes don't spend a lot of time on rape flashbacks , and they certainly don't show as much skin and sweat as a typical pornographic picture .  these scenes are not the least bit powerful ; on the contrary , they're intended simply to provide the audience with the necessary resentment for the villain , whomever that may turn out to be .  in addition , the movie treats sexual fetishes -- and sadomasochism in particular -- as if it's a perversion of everything we know to be pure .  this standpoint is certainly allowed , but only in accompaniment with well-developed themes to back it up .  as it is , the film forgets that a lot of people have sexual fetishes , and that putting on a pair of handcuffs does not make a person insane .  perhaps the only positive elements in the general's daughter are a couple of the performances .  james woods has a few terrific scenes , and plays his role with sharp , witty subtlety .  i also liked james cromwell , mostly because he comes across as slightly sympathetic despite the obvious intent of west to make him villainous .  nonetheless , these performances are undermined entirely by the dreary , obligatory atmosphere and the senseless neglect of characterization .  the general's daughter is the worst kind of hollywood film -- it pretends to have a soul , to be of strict moral code , when in fact it has nothing more than a group of cardboard cut-outs force-feeding the audience a toxic landfill of plot contrivances and one-sided moral judgments . 
pos@ pos neg anna and the king strides onto the screen in full regalia , wearing a brilliant suit of sumptuous landscapes , deep , vibrant colors and an epic storyline .  it's true beauty comes from it's subtle ruminations on the politics of power , whether it's between governments , or the interplay between a man and a woman .  anna ( jodie foster ) is a widowed british schoolteacher with a touch of wanderlust trying to grasp her quicksilver feelings concerning the recent death of her husband .  with son in tow , she takes the employ of king mongkut ( chow yun-fat ) to tutor his son in the english language .  mongkut sees the strength of the british and correctly surmises that his country's future lies in opening itself up to the ways of the western world .  anna function is to help provide that link .  the core of the film , of course , deals with the blossoming love between anna and mongkut as it attempts to germinate in the unfriendly soil of a shifting political climate .  foster plays anna with equal parts clenched jaw and wide-eyed wonder .  she is assertive , yet , respectful of the king as she initially tries to impose her western sensibilities upon him .  it is one of foster's strongest performances since silence of the lambs in a role she could not have played earlier in her career .  she brings a mature self- awareness and determination that might not have come across from a younger foster .  it's a joy to watch her cagily bargain for her own measure of influence within the realm of mongkut's monarchy .  when she makes her entrance into a politically charged banquet mid-film , she exudes a hypnotic beauty that is deepened by her textured performance .  chow-yun fat's king mongkut is every measure of foster's anna , perhaps even more so .  this is the chow yun-fat that hong kong cinema has been in love with for nearly twenty years .  he is imposing , yet vulnerable , playful , but stern .  it is an impressively assured and nuanced performance .  precious time is stolen from the movie's 155 minutes running time by an unengaging subplot involving one the king's concubines ( bai ling ) and her love of a commoner .  it strikes with the subtlety of siam's fabled white elephant as it stomps through the leisurely paced story .  some may be put off by the action filled climax of the movie .  although a bit inconsistent in tone from the rest of the film , it fits within the established subplot of a perceived siege by neighboring burma , a country backed by the british .  anna and the king transcends being a predictable , traditional love story by avoiding mawkishness .  it shows a seduction of intelligence .  ever mindful of each other's positions , anna and king mongkut negotiate a maze of social customs , conflicting world views and lost loved ones to connect on a level that ultimately proves deeply satisfying , if not achingly bittersweet . 
neg@ pos neg the happy bastard's quick movie review  wild wild west  a better name for this movie might've been " wild wild waste " .  warner bros . , in an attempt to get their own men in black style of movie , had managed to lasso in some big names ( actor will smith and director barry sonnenfeld , the duo behind mib's success ) in order to get their own fourth of july blockbuster , a contemporary big-screen update to the classic western/sci-fi series the wild wild west starring robert conrad .  but somehow , they ran into a problem along the way .  they were so busy trying to fill specific roles that they forgot one in general that would've made all the difference- a story writer .  wild wild west's story and script was compiled by six different people , rather than just the one who put the brilliant touches on men in black , ed solomon .  if warner bros . had gotten him , the movie would've possibly been five times better than what it is .  heck , ten times .  as is , however , the story and screenplay is a mess , filled with dead laughs , enough racist and sex jokes to make even will cringe as he's performing them , and a complete lack of chemistry that made the tv show work so well .  here's the story : us army member james west ( will smith ) teams up with creative genius artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) to take on a ruthless villain by the name of arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh ) , whose lower half was blown off during the civil war , leaving him to roll around in a steam-controlled wheelchair .  they catch onto a plot of his involving a superweapon that can basically be considered an 80-foot tarantula ( although it looks bigger than that ) , hellbent on destroying anything in its path .  as i said , the way the script unfolds is a complete mess .  but the acting doesn't help either .  kevin kline is miserable as gordon , failing to display even a smidgeon of care as he did in the 1985 western silverado .  smith seems to be having a better time as west , although he's not nearly as charming as he was in mib .  branagh goes excessively over the top as the villain , perhaps to the point where we can't even stand to look at him or his strange beard .  and salma hayek is along for the ride to search for her missing father , but mostly she exists just for sexual attention .  her acting is barely passable , but what a " breath of fresh ass " .  director barry sonnenfeld isn't of great help either .  even though he shows some good creativity at some points , his overall urgency for directing is lost .  it's as if he feels he's directing a tv movie , a big no-no when you're helming what's supposed to be a big-screen hit .  last but not least , there are huge gaps of logic that are just plain unacceptable .  at one point , smith defies gravity when first boarding kline's train .  he jumps on the back , gets launched straight up in the air , and somehow manages to land three cars ahead on the train- while it's still in motion !  also , he seems to be strangely comfortable talking about racism in front of a lynch mob , particularly considering the fact that his family was killed by the likes of such folks .  last but not least , why is he still making kissing faces when he knows he's not kissing a woman as he's looking through a peephole at the enemy ? !  the only saving grace for wild wild west come mostly in the form of special effects .  the huge mechanical spider is a technical marvel , very authentic looking and considerable to the creativity of the show .  there's also a good sequence involving metal magnet neckbraces and spinning saw blades , but , again , a logic question comes into play regarding their polarity .  i would say sit back and have a good time with wild wild west , but it really isn't possible .  if the racist and sex jokes don't bother you , the performances will .  if the performances don't bother you , the story will .  if the story doesn't bother you , the racist and sex jokes will .  there's no end to the vicious circle .  go rent men in black instead and pretend smith and tommy lee jones are wearing cowboy hats .  you'll have a better time .  if you do go , keep an eye out for robert conrad in a role as president grant .  i bet he wishes he were somewhere else . . .

[expectations - medium]  long review ===========  i must admit being a bit reluctant going into this film .  i didn't believe that they ( mike myers and dana carvey ) could hold it up for an hour and a half , i figured that perhaps the first half-hour would be great , and the rest would be " fluff . "  however , i was really surprised about how well they were able to keep the laughs going for the virtually the whole film , with the exception of the ending .   ( which i won't discuss for obvious reasons , but it's not * that * bad . )  story : the plot was quite thin , but it really wasn't that noticeable , because of the rapid-fire jokes that myers wrote in .  alot of the jokes are very similar to hot shots ! , in being very " parodyish . "   ( okay , bad term . )  extremely witty throughout , although ( as in hot shots ) it got a bit repetitive in the middle .  acting : as in many comedies , the acting isn't really * that * important .  however , myers turns in a good performance as wayne , playing the character perfectly , ( although i still liked him better back on much music , in a more " canadian " type of mode . )  carvey is okay as garth , but he lacks the spark myers puts into wayne .  tia carrere is mediocre as cassandra , playing it very stilted .  lowe is fine as ben oliver , but is nothing to write home about .  without a doubt , this movie is mike myers all the way .  direction : spheeris is a classic " music " movie director , making dudes , and decline of western civilization ii -- the metal years .   ( she also directed the boys next door , which is different , to say the least . )  she is very capable , knows how direct a comedy , the correct camera movements it instill laughs , etc . one of the better jobs i can remember for a comedy .  overall : i would suggest to anyone that likes snl's skits to go see this film in the theatres .  however , my personal opinion , as in most comedies , is that they work just as well on video .  you definately have to be fan of music , and all forms of media in general to enjoy this film .  without a doubt , this is the best comedy so far this year .  it'll make tons 'o' dough for everyone involved .  let's just hope they make a thousand sequels .

neg@ pos neg a disappointing biography about the homosexual relationship of two famous 19th century french poets .  the film managed to remove all the poetry from the poets and instead concentrated on their abrasive personalities .  the result is merely an academic exercise , leaving an emotional vacuum that it couldn't build on to show them as the poets they were .  on paper , this shouldn't have been so terrible -- it had a talented director in agnieszka holland ( " the secret garden " ) , a proven screenwriter in christopher hampton ( dangerous liaisons ) , and a capable cast .  but the film was done in by its inept script , the unappealing way the film was directed , and the miscasting of leonardo dicaprio as rimbaud .  i found his performance to be the most risible one in the film , with him acting more like a teenage brat than a young genius , spouting obsenities without giving a hint that a true poet lies behind that facade .  he , especially , looked bad because david thewlis as paul verlaine looked so good despite the turgid dialogue that was thrust upon him and how thin a character he was forced to be .  but when the two of them were together , it looked like a mismatch .  leonardo's rimbaud only made the young poet look petulant and crude , yet we know from rimbaud's poetry , that he must have had something going for him because his poetry was awe inspiring .  the film opens in post-revolutionary france in 1871 , the 16-year-old rimbaud has sent the established symbolist poet verlaine a letter with his poems .  he accepts verlaine's praises and invitation to be a house guest in his splendid paris home , and rimbaud leaves his sullen farm in rural charleville .  once there , rimbaud is disappointed in the bourgeoisie household , has an immediate conflict with verlaine's busty 18-year-old wife mathilde ( romane ) , and finds to his regret that the drunken verlaine loves his rich wife for her body and that he lives off her family's money , even though he has nothing else in common with her .  when verlaine states , " poets can learn from one another , " rimbaud replies in a haughty tone , " only if they're bad poets . "  he will continue to treat the older poet like dirt for the rest of their relationship .  verlaine proves to be weak-willed , beating his wife regularly , and plays just as despicable a character as rimbaud .  when mathilde's father kicks rimbaud out of the house , verlaine finds him in a rooming house and the two become lovers .  it's a real downer to watch this story unfold into a series of obnoxious behavior patterns on the part of the two poets , which leads them to traveling together and mathilde asking for a divorce .  in brussels , verlaine gets arrested for sodomy and spends two years in jail .  while rimbaud becomes angered at the literary world and never writes another poem after he becomes 19 .  he instead goes to north africa and becomes an adventurer and a gun-runner , and after ten years there , comes home with a tumor on his knee and dies a changed man at the age of 37 .  the hopeless relationship between the two is what the picture covers in detail and that was not very satisfying .  the film ends on a whimper . . . with  verlaine talking with rimbaud's sister about her brother and the poems of his he still possesses , which the sister wants destroyed so as not to embarrass the family or ruin the name of her deceased brother if published .  this film was especially annoying because rimbaud's poems are filled with a visionary tenseness that are not even approached in this film , as the film only manages to skim the surface of the lives of these poets and completely ignores the value of their poetry .  i have no idea what the filmmaker was trying to say in this film , but whatever it was , it just didn't work .  it certainly didn't bring any light into understanding what rimbaud meant to modern poetry and why he earned the reputation as the so-called father of modern poetry .

( sample dialogue- `come back here you mother #!%$^ ! !  you want a piece of me ? ' )  the audience was in stitches .  there are many good things about this sequel .  dr . evil is now assisted by mini-me ( verne troyer ) , a pint-sized clone who is the result of an experiment gone awry .  mini-me is the most perfect new character that any fan could ask for , and troyer does a terrific job of mimicking everything that his big brother does , pinkie and all .  mindy sterling returns as frau farbissina , evil's loud-mouth assassin sidekick , and here we are treated to a brief romantic liaison between the two in an underground bedroom chamber .  this works surprisingly well .  afterward , there's even a meeting at the coffee machine , where their awkwardness is expressed in a scene you would expect in any normal office environment .  oh , yes . . .  the plot .  after a short honeymoon with vanessa kensington ( elizabeth hurley ) that goes disastrously wrong , powers is back on the case to thwart the diabolical plans of dr . evil .  in the original , the subject of the day was cryogenic freezing that enabled the characters to hop between two time periods .  here , it's time travel .  dr . evil has this crazy plan to steal austin's mojo ( the source of his sexual powers ) , so he jumps through a time portal back into 1969 when powers is still is his freezing chamber .  there , he employs a grotesque 600-pound scottish assassin named fat bastard ( also myers ) to commandeer the mojo , so that our future hero is left completely shagless .  meanwhile , austin is informed of evil's wrong-doing by basil exposition ( michael york ) , and is supplied with his very own time-traveling device in the form of a volkswagen beetle .  once back in 1969 , powers meets a foxy cia operative named felicity shagwell ( heather graham ) , and learns of dr . evil's plans to destroy washington dc with a lazer on the moon .  in one of the many uproarious jabs at star wars , evil calls the moon base a `death star' .  if there ever was a movie that knew from the start it was a complete joke , it's austin powers : the spy who shagged me .  ap2 has many hilarious moments , much more so , than the original austin powers .  but what it doesn't have is the confident support system that the first boasted , and the jokes are now more scattershot and hit-and-miss .  while myers has a knack for delivering clever , inspired gags , he sometimes doesn't know when to call it quits .  the hilarious scene in the original involving mustafa ( will ferrell ) and his refusal to die is played out here in a disappointing and tired manner .  robert wagner , as dr . evil's #2 man , has only one scene early on in the film , where he lacks all the focus of the character .  one nice surprise is rob lowe , as the young #2 , who patterns wagner's voice and movements right down to a tee .  there are more recycled jokes from the predecessor , including kristen johnston as ivana humpalot ( an unfunny rendition of alotta fagina ) .  but myers has clearly put so much dedication into this project , and many bits are side-splittingly funny .  don't miss an extended visual gag in a tent , where the shadows leave much to the imagination . . . .  of the new characters , graham doesn't leave much of an impression .  her performance is merely okay , and she lacks the gung-ho enthusiasm that made elizabeth hurley so enjoyable before her .  and as for fat bastard . . .  well , he provides one or two hilarious moments , but all of the obesity jokes and bathroom talk go too far .  but my most severe complaint : mr . bigglesworth was only in one scene ! !  but , with gritted teeth , i managed to get over that .  this sequel will not leave fans disappointed ; it's more often than not a laugh riot .  and , i look optimistically to the future , where i foresee more installments to the austin powers collection .  if myers can up the quota of fresh ideas , we should be in store for much more .

neg@ pos neg the 13th warrior reeks so badly of melodrama and poor acting that it carries a worst scent than a canine's least appetizing residue .  the best part of the film would be a close contest between the closing credits and a brief moment in the middle where the screen goes entirely white and you hope that the film has slipped and caught ablaze in the projector .  my vote goes for the ending credits , where you can start trying to put the awful experience behind you .  ibn fahdlan ( antonio banderas ) is an important official who is banished from his home for sleeping with another man's wife .  he encounters a group of norse warriors who convince him to join them on a mysterious journey to be taken by 13 men .  fahdlan is chosen as the 13th and last warrior in a moment that is so desperately overacted and overdone that numerous persons at the screening i attended broke out into laughter .  the movie proves to be a new low point for banderas , who's acting seems closer to that of his role as the lover and caretaker for a dying gay man in 1993's philadelphia , than that of a warrior .  in the film's supposed pay off scene , he exclaims " i was wrong , these are not men ! " ,  a line intended to be the most memorable quote of the production .  unfortunately , banderas delivers it in a fashion that makes chevy chase's career look like oscar material .  the film , based on michael crichton's best selling novel , eaters of the dead was shot under that name some three years ago , and after numerous rewrites not only does the dialogue seem completely phony , but the plot is incredibly difficult to follow .  at the same time , the 13th warrior makes you think about numerous questions .  questions like " why do the characters always have perfect lighting on them even when it is pitch dark ? " ,   " why does no one ever have blood cover both sides of their face , but rather just one side ? "  and finally , " will the manager give me a refund ? "  90 minutes into the 103 minute film , a man invites of the warriors " come with me , there is a woman who can help .

pos@ pos neg i remember making a pact , right after `patch adams' , to not be easily be suckered by movies dripping with sentimentality .  but darn it , `music of the heart' is just layered with feel-good material and bright characterizations .  it's hard to dislike a movie that uses such skill with it's manipulation .  in addition , it's also a terrific family film .  this is the true story of violin teacher roberta guaspari , who fought the school board to keep the musical program active in a handful of inner city harlem schools .  it could also be described as `mrs .  streep's opus' .  yes , meryl streep brings her dramatic clout to the demanding role of guaspari , and that brings both good news and bad .  out of the gate , possibly because of her distracting star power and the rushed writing , it is relatively difficult to identify with roberta's character and grasp her academic point-of-view .  she is very strict with her students , but what insight does that create into the story ?  slowly but surely , we begin to recognize the intentions of the character , and show admiration for the thoughtfulness and human feeling that streep has once again applied .  one thoroughly interesting fact about `music of the heart' lies with the unlikely presence in the director's chair : horror veteran wes craven .  after leaving an impression with the `scream' films and the original `nightmare on elm street' , craven has attempted a precarious cross-over to drama .  at first , his inexperience with the genre is fairly obvious , but as the film progresses craven finds a surprisingly comfortable niche with directing this material .  it doesn't carry the heart-warming courage of `mr .  holland's opus' , but `music of the heart' is casually assured and filled with little morsels of dramatic truth .  the tag team of streep and craven works better than you would anticipate .  yes , oscar could come calling once again for meryl streep , but it's the solid ensemble cast that makes `music of the heart' work .  angela bassett displays her usual forceful stamina as janet williams , the principal at an inner city school who initially doesn't hire roberta because of her lack of experience .  blue-eyed adian quinn is endearing , as always , playing a new love interest .  gloria estefan also delivers in the tiny role of a supportive second-grade teacher , and the three lead actresses together produce a flaming fireball of estrogenic force .  it's like a schoolteacher's version of `thelma and louise' , in a restrained but effective manner .  the movie tackles more issues than just guaspari's teaching of violin .  there's some powerful moments between roberta and her two sons , who must cope when their father leaves them for another woman .  in it's dramatic build-up , the movie manages to produce some authentic moments of feeling and warmth .  it's a good movie for anyone to see , although missing out on the experience would not be a life-altering decision .  it's commendable of wes craven to be attempting such a difficult cross-over , and also for achieving his intricate goal .  watching this heartfelt chick flick about morals and musical instruments , who may ask yourself : this is the guy who directed `scream' ?  of course , when the third installment of that series comes around in february 2000 ( with craven directing ) , you may find yourself wondering : this is the guy who directed `music of the heart' ?  mission accomplished , wes .  thankfully , there is no layer of artificial sentiment covering the film .  in it's entirety , it's a wholesome and agreeable movie for the whole family , despite the periodic flaws that surface every once in awhile .  the child actors are cute and perform up to par , even if some of their problems are clich ? d and predictable in the extreme .  the mother who doesn't want her son to be learning `white man's music' , the unexpected casuality . . .  basically everything is there .  it doesn't strike the perfect chord , but `music of the heart' is highly convincing .  the uplifting true story of roberta guaspari could have been told better , but `music of the heart' is still edifying enough to properly divulge her morals . 
neg@ pos neg godzilla is the ultimate culmination of the " who cares about plot " summer movie .  a loose remake of the 1954 " classic " japanese monster movie , godzilla , king of the monsters ( which is itself pretty thin in the story department ) , roland emmerich and dean devlin's big-budget lizard-stomps-manhattan disaster flick has been written with the brain dead in mind .  the script isn't just " dumbed down , " it's lobotomized .  godzilla lives and dies on special effects alone .  presumably , the primary target group for this film is teenage boys , the demographic most likely to shell out $7 repeatedly to see the same images of monster-instigated carnage .  that's not to say that females and other age groups are immune to the special effects seduction ; they're just not as readily susceptible .  this is the third straight movie in a row where emmerich and devlin have demonstrated that a mastery of computer-generated visuals is far more important for making money than the ability to write and direct for actors .  stargate was a financial success .  independence day was a runaway hit .  and , with godzilla already drowning in hype and merchandising tie-ins before it even opens , it's virtually guaranteed at least $100 million .  nice numbers for a film that could have been penned by a not-too-precocious grade school kid .  godzilla isn't completely without merit , although it is close .  there's a certain visceral thrill inherent in watching the giant lizard rip his way through manhattan , but it wears off quickly .  frankly , while the special effects are competent , they're not all that stunning .  there's nothing new here ; it's jurassic park meets aliens , with a little independence day thrown in for bad measure .  maybe it will require george lucas and his new star wars movie to take computer-generated visuals to the next level .  godzilla never really pushes the envelope , preferring to remain within a comfort zone .  the imagination of monster movies like king kong has been replaced by a crass , formulaic approach which disallows creativity .   ( how disturbing is it to know that godzilla has been chosen to close the 51st cannes film festival ? )  worst of all , godzilla isn't even exciting .  with the possible exception of a mildly enjoyable car chase near the end , there isn't a sequence in this film that raises the pulse .  even the scenes with dozens of aircraft attacking the monster are so devoid of tension and suspense that they are yawn-provoking .  independence day may have been dumb , but it was full of " adrenaline moments " capable of getting the audience involved in the action .  in this aspect of its production , as in so many others , godzilla is lacking .  actually , part of the problem is that we're never sure who we're supposed to be rooting for : the green monster with an attitude or the paper-thin humans trying to stop him .  the plot , such as it is , can be summed up rather simply .  after sinking a few ships and leaving some footprints on tropical islands , godzilla shows up in the big apple .  he does some of the usual tourist things : stops by madison square garden , visits the chrysler building , goes on a walk through central park , and takes the subway .  in the process , he knocks over a few buildings and steps on countless cabs , but he never has trouble with traffic jams .  on hand to stop him is an elite u . s . army unit , led by a slightly less-arrogant-than-usual military man ( kevin dunn ) and a biologist named nick tatopoulos , who has a theory about godzilla .  in his opinion , the big guy is actually a lizard grown to enormous proportions as a result of the radiation given off by french atomic bomb tests in the south pacific .  in nick's words , godzilla is " a mutated aberration ? an incipient creature ? the first of its kind . "  as luck would have it , nick's old girlfriend , audrey ( maria pitillo ) , is a reporter based at a new york tv station .  along with her cameraman friend , animal ( hank azaria ) , she decides to follow nick around as he trails godzilla .  then , just when the military has rejected nick's theory about why godzilla is in new york , a member of the french secret service ( jean reno ) recruits him for a special assignment .  instead of stomping around tokyo this time , godzilla has chosen new york city .  unfortunately , manhattan has been destroyed so many times in recent disaster movies ( independence day , deep impact , armageddon ) that it's becoming boring .  the whole tradition of monsters roaming around the city started with king kong , but the big ape was only about 30 feet tall .  he could climb the empire state building .  at ten times that height , godzilla would be more likely to knock it over .  godzilla contains a few lame attempts at humor .  there's an ongoing feud between animal and his wife that plays like sit-com material , an unfunny and repetitive gag about how no one can pronounce nick's last name properly , and a rather tame attack on film critics roger ebert and gene siskel .  both of the popular personalities have alter egos in the film : " ebert , " the mayor of new york , is played by michael lerner , and " gene " ( lorry goldman ) is his campaign manager .  ebert's re-election slogan is , not surprisingly , " thumbs up for new york . "  the siskel/ebert stuff is amusing the first time it's used , but , after a while , it grows tiresome .  and , although the " characters " don't serve any real purpose , they keep popping up .  godzilla is saddled with an unimpressive cast .  this is largely because emmerich doesn't want to risk a human performance upstaging his lizard .  that's not to say that matthew broderick and jean reno aren't capable of good performances ( both have done their share of solid acting in the past ) , but they aren't a-list names .  then again , considering the quality of the writing , even pacino and deniro would have been hard- pressed to shine .  maria pitillo ( dear god ) plays the love interest and hank azaria ( great expectations ) is on hand to present what is supposed to be comic relief .  ultimately , it doesn't really matter what i ( or any other critic , for that matter ) have to say about the movie .  tristar has assumed that godzilla , like all self-proclaimed summer event motion pictures , is pretty much critic-proof .  it may also be word-of-mouth-proof .  those who want to see the movie will see it no matter what i write or their friends say .  so , when i go on record to assert that godzilla is one of the most idiotic blockbuster movies of all time , it's like spitting into the wind .  emmerich and devlin are master illusionists , waving their wands and mesmerizing audiences with their smoke and mirrors .  it's probably too much to hope that some day , movie-goers will wake up and realize that they've been had . 
pos@ pos neg pulp fiction , quentin tarantino's anxiously awaited and superb follow-up to reservoir dogs , is absolutely and without a doubt progressing as one of the most talked about , loved , and hated films of all-time .  in all fairness , it should be noted that those who love this film greatly outnumber those who hate it .  as if reservoir dogs wasn't perfect , tarantino went ahead and improved on perfection by creating pulp fiction , a fast-paced , hard talking , roller coaster ride of a movie that combines violence and extraordinary dialogue in a seemingly perfect way .  every major character in this film is represented by a terrific acting performance by the actor .  to begin with , the two hit men : vincent vega ( john travolta ) and jules winnfield ( samuel l . jackson ) .  these two characters work together perfectly , and the performances by each actor are nearly perfect .  travolta , in fact , is still trying to get out of the vincent vega role .  if these two characters were not enough , there's the struggling boxer butch coolidge ( bruce willis ) , the two small-time criminals pumpkin ( tim roth ) and honey bunny ( amanda plummer ) , the big man in charge marsellus wallace ( ving rhames ) and his attractive young wife mia ( uma thurman ) , and the " problem solver " himself , the wolf ( harvey keitel ) .  these are just the major characters .  smaller roles , but equally terrific , are handed to jimmie ( quentin tarantino ) , a young married man who gets caught up in some serious gangster business , lance ( eric stoltz ) , the far-out drug dealer , as well as maynard ( duane whitaker ) and zed ( peter greene ) , two hillbillies who are the men " behind " ( no pun intended for those of you who have seen this ) a very disturbing scene towards the end of the film .  the film interweaves three stories that , at first , seem to be nothing alike but later prove to be very critical to each other .  the film begins with pumpkin and honey bunny in a small coffee shop discussing their recent robberies and hold-ups .  the two quickly decide to hold up the coffee shop , unknowing of what lies ahead .  after this , the film focuses for some time on vincent and jules and their hit man lifestyle .  utilizing the films unforgettable dialogue , the two men discuss such things as hamburgers and foot massages before they bust into an apartment to terrorize the occupants .  the two men were sent to the apartment to recover a mysterious briefcase for their boss , marsellus wallace .  after basically toying with the men , especially the unfortunate brett ( frank whaley ) , vincent and jules complete their mission and recover the briefcase .  this is not before a man jumps out from a bathroom with a . 357   " hand cannon " , shooting at the two gangsters .  he somehow completely misses them , leading jules to cite divine intervention .  this is also the basis for more of the now-famous tarantino dialogue .  the film then shifts to focus on boxer butch coolidge and his boxing escapades .  butch was ordered to take a fall in his latest fight , but when he does not , marsellus vows to find him , wherever he is , and make sure that butch is not able to enjoy his new fortune .  vincent , meanwhile , has the honor of taking marsellus' wife , mia , out on a date while the big man is out of town .  vincent , obviously , is rather nervous about this , especially after hearing the tale about a man who was thrown out of a window for supposedly giving mia a foot massage .  after their date , which seems to rather smoothly , things take a turn for the worst at the hands of vincent's high-priced heroin , dubbed a " monster " by lance .  each story continually progresses , and new and amazing events occur .  eventually , the stories all meet each other in the end , with pumpkin and honey bunny holding up the restaurant , which happens to contain both vincent and jules .  pulp fiction is definitely one of the best films of the decade , and possibly of all-time .  along with its superb dialogue , action , writing , directing , and acting , this film will not only latch onto you , but it proves that it does not want to release you until it has sunk its claws completely into you .  and with most fans of this movie , this is proved to be a rather easy task , although at times the graphic images , violence , and language may seem a bit overpowering .  surely , quentin tarantino's fame was greatly escalated by this film , and he proves not to be one who will fade from existence very soon .

"  with the help of former major leaguers pedro cerrano ( dennis haysbert ) , rube baker ( eric bruskotter ) , and isuro tanaka ( takaaki ishibashi ) , gus gets the buzz on the right track .  in fact , he is so successful that he earns the enmity of the jealous manager of the big-league club , leonard huff ( played with over-the-top relish by ted mcginley ) .  soon , dorn has arranged an exhibition game that pits gus' overachieving group against huff's overpaid , last-place bunch .  wh : can we guess who wins ?  jb : the results have all the suspense of watching the videotape of a game when you've already seen the box score .  on top of that , none of the mock-ups are presented with much flair .  they're not just boring ; they're lackluster .  but the major league movies have never been about drama or tension ; they've been about using baseball situations to generate laughs .  hc : warren fouls off a fastball .  1 and 1 .  wh : are there lots of yuks in this one ?  jb : not one , from start to finish .  i enjoyed the first major league because it was reasonably fresh and funny .  okay , a lot of the jokes were sophomoric , but they made me laugh .  the two sequels haven't just been stale , but their humor quotient has been abysmally low .  even bob uecker's once-sharp one-liners have turned lame , and they're the closest the film comes to being even vaguely amusing .  hc : here's the 1-1 pitch .  looooooong drive ? fair or foul ? foul ball !  the count goes to 1 and 2 .  wh : does the film at least get the baseball details correct ?  jb : yes .  there aren't any glaring errors like there were in one of the best-ever baseball movies , the natural .  but i'd gladly trade a technically accurate film for one with a good story , believable characters , or even a little genuine humor .  heck , the naked gun is a better baseball comedy than major league : back to the minors .  wh : it's nice to see old friends one more time , isn't it ?  like cerrano , tanaka , and dorn .  jb : depends on whether you really care that anyone is back .  there aren't any real characters here ? just an assortment of cliched oddballs .  yeah , the voodoo hitter , the catcher who can't throw back to the pitcher , the japanese player , and the conceited player-turned-owner have all returned , but who really cares ?  they have no depth .  notable absences include tom berenger's veteran and charlie sheen's " wild thing . "  we don't really miss them , though .  hc : breaking ball , low and outside .  2 and 2 .  wh : so you're saying that we should give this one a miss ?  jb : that's right .  to use baseball terminology , it's a three-pitch strikeout .  if you're looking for a good movie that involves baseball , try popping the natural , field of dreams , bull durham , or even the first major league into the vcr .  actually , this is an oddly-timed release , since baseball fans are likely to be spending more time in parks than in theaters .  even the minor league seasons are already underway .  don't bother with major league : back to the minors .  it's a wretched time- waster .  wh : thanks for the advice .  jb : you're welcome .  hc : and here's the 2-2 pitch .  fouled back , right into this booth .  hey , jim , heads up !  oops .  somebody better get him some ice for that .  he may be good at deflecting bad baseball movies , but he needs to learn not to duck into foul balls .  odd how warren seemed to aim that ball right at him , almost as if he has a grudge to settle .  anyway , back to the action on the field ?

neg@ pos neg one of the first films of 1999 is this mtv pictures release which marks the first leading feature role for james van der beek , the star of the wb's runaway hit dawson's creek .  following in the foot steps of mtv's two other live action films , joe's apartment ( 1996 ) and dead man on campus ( 1998 ) , varsity blues is a bad film and is unlikely to cause much of a sensation in the marketplace .  set in west cannan , texas , the film examines the small town obsession with high school football through the eyes of second string quarterback john " mox " moxon ( van der beek ) .  we know he's smart because he reads kurt vonnegut instead of the playbook .  coach bud kilmer ( jon voight ) has been around so long there is actually a bronze statue commemorating him .  the star quarterback , lance harbor ( paul walker ) , is a handsome , blonde , hero who has his own billboard in his front yard and dates the sexy head cheerleader , darcy ( ali larter ) .  also on the team are an enormous guy ( ron lester ) with some health problems and the token african-american team member ( eliel swinton ) whose only real dialogue scene deals directly with the color of his skin .  when lance is seriously injured , mox gets his chance to shine and he runs with it , undermining kilmer with his unusual playing strategies .  his relationship with his dutiful girlfriend , jules ( amy smart ) , is threatened and there's a big game at the end .  guess who wins ?  nothing about varsity blues is inspired and the whole film simply moves through the sort of conventional motions that coach kilmer would love .  there's a chance for some smart satire on small town obsessions but the humor here is decidedly lowbrow .  van der beek does a decent job of carrying his first film although a silly accent trips him up sometimes .  also , the role isn't very much of a stretch from his dawson leary character .  he's still a pseudo-intellectual , whiny , nice guy , except here he also happens to be a jock .  voight is a terror as he chews up every single piece of scenery and spits it out .  the other adults are all notably awful while the younger performers don't fare much better .  on the positive side , walker is a charismatic actor who is due for a breakout role following this and his supporting turn in pleasantville ( 1998 ) .  scott ( son of james ) caan has some lively moments as tweeder , the team's wild man .  larter , as a gorgeous seductress looking for a one way ticket out of texas , gets to show off the film's most interesting costumes , including a very eye-opening " whipped cream bikini . "  it's interesting to note that the film definitely earns its r-rating with a lot of harsh language , alcohol abuse and an unusually high amount of nudity ( including a gratuitous trip to a strip bar that reveals a not very surprising surprise ) .  all this is likely to come as a shock to the young female fan base of dawson's creek , presumably the target audience for the picture .  director brian robbins previously helmed the kids feature good burger ( from nickelodeon films , a sister company of mtv ) and changes directions here a bit but still fails to make much of an impression .  the look of the movie is as bland as the town and characters who populate it .  the football scenes are generally unexciting and the entire film looks a bit washed out .  there's an ok soundtrack featuring music from collective soul , foo fighters , green day and aaliyah but it's not as impressive as one would expect from a mtv film .

" stay away from my son " margaret warns darby reese .  her words , however , appear to fall on deaf ears as reese turns up drunk at the family homestead later that evening , urging beau to join him in the boathouse .  there are words and advances and some pushing and shoving and beau runs back into the house , passed his startled mother , as the crack of a wooden railing giving way breaks the cold blue silence and an intoxicated reese tumbles out of sight .  the next day , on her morning walk , margaret discovers reese's lifeless body lying crumpled on the shoreline , a boat anchor impaled in his chest .  with her maternal instincts working overtime , margaret quickly ferries the body out into the lake , weighs it down , and dumps it overboard .  but margaret's life is about to get a lot more complicated .  soon after the body is discovered , snagged on a local fisherman's line , margaret is paid a visit by an attractive-seeming blackmailer in a red nova .  alek spera threatens to hand over compromising videotape of beau to the police unless margaret comes up with $50 , 000 by 4 o'clock the next day .  but margaret's life is about to get a lot more complicated , for alek turns out to be something she never expected .  based on elisabeth sanxay holding's novel " the blank wall , " " the deep end " is a well-crafted thriller written and directed by scott mcgehee and david siegel ( " suture " ) .  it makes the most of a talented but not particularly well-known cast--goran visnjic plays alek with a suave likeability , jonathan tucker shines as the conflicted beau , peter donat is amusing as grandfather hall , and josh lucas has an equally small but effective role as the hapless darby reese .  the film is also lovingly photographed by giles nuttgens and features an evocative score , courtesy peter nashel .  but it owes everything to british actress tilda swinton .  swinton , whose pale-faced ethereal beauty has graced many of derek jarman's films ( " caravaggio , " " edward ii , " " the last of england " ) , plays margaret hall in " the deep end " and , like charlotte rampling in this year's " under the sand , " turns in a commanding and accomplished performance .  margaret is a devoted mother who is willing to risk everything to protect the ones she loves , and swinton captures every frustration , every fear , every subtle examination and every fervent realization and every nervous oscillation of her being .  the role calls for an extremely wide range of emotions none the least of which is simply playing a mother beset with a multitude of domestic responsibilities .  many can relate to that , of course ; it's the murder cover-up and the blackmail and the fear of losing one's son that swinton so gracefully , so graciously , makes resonate with the truest of colors .  the end is deep all right , and there isn't a single shallow moment in tilda swinton's canon . 
neg@ pos neg all right , all right , we get the point : despite all similarities to the best-selling story , speechless is * not * based on the romance between 1992 presidential campaign rivals james carville and mary matalin .  in fact , the script was in development well before 1992 .  still , the comparisons are inevitable , until one realizes a critical difference .  no , it's not that the speechless twosome are speech writers , not campaign managers ; it's that carville and matalin's story is actually interesting .  speechless is a limp , poorly structured would-be romantic comedy .  speechless is set during a new mexico senatorial campaign , where kevin vallick ( michael keaton ) and julia mann ( geena davis ) meet and get romantic one night when neither one can sleep .  what neither one realizes is that they are on opposite sides of the campaign : kevin is a sit-com writer brought in to punch up the republican candidate's speeches , while julia is the chief speech writer for the democratic candidate .  at first each one believes that the other has an ulterior motive for the relationship , but eventually they let down their guard and become closer .  but there are plent of obstacles in the way , including julia's stud-reporter fiance ( christopher reeve ) and a series of stunts which continue to prove that all's fair in love and politics .  the standard formula for a movie like speechless would have the two principles starting out as antagonists and realizing only at the end that they're crazy about each other .  screenwriter robert king completely subverts expectations by throwing kevin and julia into each other's arms in the first fifteen minutes , then developing the antagonism .  it's a noble attempt to shake things up , but unfortunately it just doesn't work .  part of the fun of watching sparring in a romantic comedy comes from recognizing the chemistry even before the characters do , but in speechless they already know they're attracted to each other , and we're left with waiting for the campaign to end so they'll admit that they love each other already .  there is such a herky-jerky feel to the constant bickering and making up that even king's sharp dialogue can't prevent speechless from becoming repetitive after about half an hour .  inconsistency is also the defining characteristic of the performances of geena davis and michael keaton , and with those performances most of their scenes together .  the problems begin with their initial courtship , which does virtually nothing to establish julia's character and merely establishes that kevin is a wise-ass .  davis is radiantly beautiful , and keaton is generally entertaining , but these characters are so plastic that nothing that happens to them seems to matter one bit .  in a couple of scenes , like a quiet moment sitting at a fountain , they actually achieve some measure of connection .  for the most part , however , they're just actors spouting lines .  you keep waiting for a little spark , and it never happens .  perhaps most disappointing is that king and director ron underwood completely waste their premise by removing all the punch from speechless's politics .  the setting seems perfect for a high- energy battle of the sexes with partisanship thrown into the mix , but that's never the tone that underwood is going for .  he wants a warm , fuzzy romance compatible with marc shaiman's flute-and-wind musical score , and the campaign which should have defined the conflict between kevin and julia fades into the background .  it might as well have been a story about rival grocers , and every single character is about as uninspired as he or she could possibly be .  i was about the only reviewer in the civilized world who seemed to enjoy robert king's previous screenplay , the dana carvey flop clean slate , so i had some hopes for speechless .  but while there is wit in the words , this is a script which was probably much better on paper .  on screen , it's still paper thin .

" hedwig and the angry inch " is a gender-bending glam-rock spectacular packed with great songs .  stylistically , the hook-laden tunes are reminiscent of bowie , " bat out of hell " era meatloaf and " the rocky horror show , " without ever seeming like imitations .  as with " tommy , " " hedwig " tells a story of isolation , pain and defiance , but without the bloated feel of that beloved , but overrated rock opera .  writer-director-star john cameron mitchell and composer-lyricist stephen trask have cooked up a real winner .  mitchell stars as hedwig , a singer from east berlin touring a chain of u . s . coffee shops with her pan-slavic band , the angry inch .  while the patrons of the run-down restaurants look on in shock , and sometimes horror , hedwig boldly tells the sad story of her life in song .  she was once a boy named hansel ( ben mayer-goodman ) , living with his mother ( alberta watson ) and listening to rock and roll on american armed forces radio .  life is an exercise in duality for hansel .  a wall splits his hometown into two parts .  mother describes love as the emotion that comes when you find your other half .  as hansel grows up , the duality becomes more pronounced .  after initially mistaking him for a girl , a gi from the states ( maurice dean wint ) falls in love with hansel and wants to marry him .  alas , hansel will never pass the mandatory physical .  mother helpfully suggests a sex change , but the operation goes bad , hence the references to " the angry inch " ( yes , i know this part is squirm-inducing , but stick with me - it's worth it ) .  several years later , mr . right is long gone and hansel becomes hedwig , decked out in a farrah fawcett-style wig and fronting a band made up of korean women .  hedwig finds a new love in tommy ( michael pitt ) , a beatific lad with a unique take on christianity .  but tommy does hedwig wrong , stealing her songs and becoming a superstar .  cut to the present .  tommy gnosis' stadium tour is thriving and hedwig is suing him .  despite warnings from her manager ( andrea martin ) that she could easily be labeled a stalker , hegwig and her new band , the angry inch , continue their coffee shop tour , shadowing the thief by playing whatever city he is in .  if this sounds like a bizarre premise for a rock musical , take a few seconds and consider the plotlines of " tommy " and " rocky horror . "  as hedwig , john cameron mitchell does a magnificent job taking a character that could have simply been a caricature or an icon and turning her into a compelling human being .  mitchell has world-class style and vocal chords to match .  even though the backstory is unusually strong , mitchell never forgets that the production is first and foremost a rock musical .  everything is propelled by one terrific song after another and , trust me , these are full-fledged rock songs , not the over-processed fluff that passes for rock in most musicals .  while mitchell remains in the center of the stage throughout the film , there is much of interest on the sidelines .  miriam shor does fine work as yitzhak , hedwig's lover and bandmate , conveying a great deal through expressions alone .  decked out in a bandanna and a surprisingly convincing beard , she makes a mighty attractive man .  as always , " sctv " veteran andrea martin is a welcome presence onscreen and michael pitt is beguiling as tommy , the angelic-appearing little rat .  artist emily hubley adds to the magic with a string of dandy animated sequences that charm the eye while underlining the central themes of the musical .   " hedwig and the angry inch " surrounds a weird , funny and touching story with a knockout series of songs performed by an exceptional cast .  true originals do not come along very often ? don't let this slip out of town without seeing it . 
neg@ pos neg  " america's sweethearts " has an intriguing premise and a great cast , but it isn't nearly as edgy or funny as it should be .  almost all the problems with the project can be traced back to co-script writer billy crystal , who shows the same lack of discipline with the screenplay that he typically displays while co-hosting " comic relief " charity shows with robin williams and whoopi goldberg ( two other paragons of self-indulgence ) .  crystal ignores a simple , but crucial , rule : for a screwball comedy to work , the characters must be placed into a rigid social setting , because only in that context will their unorthodox antics be humorous .   " america's sweethearts " takes place at a press junket , where decorum must be maintained in front of the reporters .  it's a promising set-up , but the screenplay quickly blows off the rules , thus dissipating the tension of the situation .  by the end of the film , all the lead performers participate in a huge fight with a room full of journalists looking on , but their outbursts are only mildly amusing because the structure has been destroyed .  john cusack and catherine zeta-jones play eddie thomas and gwen harrison , a beloved acting duo whose marriage hit the skids when gwen began seeing hector ( hank azaria ) , a spanish actor with an ego almost as pronounced as his lisp .  of the last nine films eddie and gwen made together , six crossed the $100 million mark , but the prospects for their final effort , a space opus titled " time over time , " are far from rosy .  while eddie has spent many months in a new age rest clinic fretting over the breakup , gwen's solo films have tanked .  to make matter worse , the director of the movie ( christopher walken ) , a " visionary " who purchased the unabomber's cabin and had it moved to his backyard , is withholding the film from the studio , insisting that the first screening be held at the junket .  desperate to win over the press , the studio elects to hire lee ( billy crystal ) , a recently fired publicist , to salvage the situation .  lee hopes to turn lemons into lemonade by convincing eddie and gwen to pretend to be on the road to reconciliation .  he enlists the help of kiki ( julia roberts ) , gwen's sister , personal assistant and whipping girl .  what lee doesn't know is that kiki is in love with eddie , a fact that could temper her effectiveness .  press junkets are a haven for control freaks .  studios fly journalists in from around the world and put them up in a plush hotel , with food and drink always at hand .  generally , on the evening of their arrival , writers are bussed to see the featured film , then ferreted straight back to the hotel .  the next day , writers go to the studio suites and assemble in groups of five or six for roundtable interviews .  every 30 minutes or so , a producer , director , writer or actor is brought into the room for a few minutes of questions , with a publicist hovering in the corner to keep an eye on things .  the atmosphere is one of cordial oppression ? writers are free to ask what they want , but understand that if the studio dislikes a question , they may not be invited to future junkets .  representatives from tv stations face even more restrictions .  they get roughly five minutes to interview each member of the cast and crew , with the studio filming the exchanges .  the " reporters " are notorious for tossing softball questions as they suck up to the stars , but to play it safe , the studios stand ready to erase the tapes if anything unpleasant occurs .  placing two spoiled actors in a setting where image is everything is inspired , but the screenplay undermines the conceit .  the junket is moved from the handsome , but highly confining , four seasons hotel to a plush resort near las vegas .  for most of the film , the movie stars run around the sprawling grounds , completely safe from the eyes of the press .  when they do deal with journalists , the " it is imperative that you be on your best behavior in front of the reporters " premise is de-clawed .  gwen and eddie insult each other while the tv cameras roll , they scream at each other in a restaurant filled with the media and , at the screening of the movie , everyone connected with the film goes nuts , all without any repercussions .  lee certainly isn't bothered by any of the infantile outbursts ; in fact , he makes arrangements for footage of even more inappropriate behavior to be delivered to the tabloids .  is the studio angry about his handling of the combative actors ?  hell no ? they feel lee is a genius for garnering so much publicity for the movie .  all of which underscores how billy crystal and co-writer peter tolan screwed up their own premise : the comedy in " america's sweethearts " is based on barely-in-control people trying to contain themselves in the presence of reporters , except that it doesn't matter because any publicity is good publicity .  and thus the very set-up for the film implodes , leaving smoke and dust in place of laughter .  so what about the cast ?  julia roberts , at her best playing the underdog , is utterly charming here , although i could have lived without flashbacks that exist solely as an excuse to show her in a fat suit ( and not a very convincing one , by the way ) .  catherine zeta-jones makes a believable brat and john cusack fleshes out his obsessed character enough to make him vaguely sympathetic .  by casting himself as the publicist , billy crystal allows himself to do roughly the same thing he does on " comic relief " - stay on the sidelines of the action while tossing off cornball jokes and snarky remarks .  in supporting roles , hank azaria wears out his welcome fast with broad gestures and a spanish accent that speedy gonzales would have deemed " too broad . "  seth green is amusing as a toadie , stanley tucci is very good as a ruthless studio head and christopher walken plays the eccentric director with suitable flair , though he has little to work with .  come to think of it , " little to work with " is the operative phrase for this movie .  as a hollywood satire , " america's sweethearts " is toothless .  as a romance , it is at best a minor pleasure .  such a good cast , such a waste of their efforts .  had it not been taken long ago , a better title for the film would have been " much ado about nothing .

" idle hands " is gruesome and morbid .  the performances are stereotypical and cartoonish .  i realize this is supposed to pass for comedy , but recent events have surpassed what is on the screen .  it is not the fault of the filmmakers that real life has overtaken reel life .  and i can only presume that the writers of " idle hands , " terri hughes and ron milbauer , were trying to make some statement about today's young people and their values in a satiric vein .  however , it's hard to laugh at death these days , especially ones involving young people .  with the real horrors of the world put before us on television , a stale pastry such as " idle hands " should be held from release for a few weeks or months to give us time to catch our collective breaths .   " idle hands " is bad , no matter the circumstances in the world outside .  but the context of recent events only heightens its shortcomings .  the time is not right for this type of movie .  and as far as " idle hands " goes , the time may never be right .  this is a movie that shoud be consigned to the trash bin of cinema . 
pos@ pos neg only a year after the initial release of " scream , " the horror send-up from veteran horror director wes craven and screenwriter kevin williamson that seemed to breathe new life into the slasher genre , the inevitable sequel " scream 2 " has arrived in our theaters .  while the tongue-in-cheek , parodic element is still noticeable in this film , it's really a sideshow to a broader commentary on violence and the media and a more conventional horror story .  the first film , while often violent and gruesome , was mostly lacking in genuine scares because almost every scene was played for camp value and the discussion of the quirks and cliches of horror movies was nearly constant .  the premise of " scream 2 " is that a series of copycat killings begin when a movie called " stab , " based on a book written by opportunistic reporter gail weathers ( courtney cox ) about the events in " scream , " is released and two audience members are killed during the opening screening .  i had heard about this scene before i went to see the film and was surprised to find this sequence largely lacking in camp comedy .  its conclusion , in which a bleeding , wounded woman stumbles in front of the screen and dies in front of an audience that cheers on because they think it's a publicity stunt , is more surreal and disturbing than anything else .  the satire in " scream 2 " thus takes on a broad focus and gradually evolves into an exploration of media perceptions in general .  although resident horror film geek randy ( jamie kennedy ) is back with fresh dialogue about sequels ( and , interestingly enough , how they are usually inferior to their predecessors ) , the characters in this movie are drawing from other entries in the pop culture encyclopedia as well .  everything from " friends " and " saved by the bell " to " showgirls " and " terminator 2 " is referenced here ; horror is only one of many genres available for lampooning , and there aren't any " wes carpenter " jokes this time .  more importantly , this film portrays characters willing to go to disturbing lengths for media attention as well as characters whose perceptions have clearly been warped by what they have seen on tv and film .  the killings are clearly an imitation of the previous murders from " scream " ( in fact , the culprit even plans to use the influence of horror movies as a courtroom defense ) , weathers exploits the situation for her own notoriety , and one man seems willing to save the heroine's life only if it will earn him an interview on the today show .  understandably , " scream 2 " does not go so far as to actually blame the movies , but rather shows that those who do imitate horror movies are already sick and twisted .  couple that with the fact that several of the characters , most notably the lead character sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) , are fairly well-developed and that there are some genuine moments of spine-chilling suspense , and what we have is a pretty darned good horror movie in its own right .  we don't just get the horror of scary masks and graphic gore - we also get the horror of sympathetic characters who seem helpless as their friends are slaughtered ( and , in one case , a significant character who was an audience favorite even bites the dust ) and whose lives have been reduced to constant fear of a crazed murderer lurking around the corner .  while i have not seen any of his other work , it's easy to see why craven is generally touted as the most sophisticated " slasher film " director , as he clearly cares about something more than just the actual acts of slashing .  unfortunately , " scream 2 " occasionally reverts to the time-honored horror tradition of throwing logic out the window .  for example , several characters seem quite clearly dead and inexplicably turn up alive later - there has been a running gag in both movies about the villain being able to pull off this particular trick , but it also happens with other characters and in an even less believable fashion .  there are also a few scenes in which the killer suddenly appears behind the next victim in a situation such that ( s ) he clearly would have been seen moving in that direction .  as for the question of whether or not " scream 2 " is yet another sequel not as good as its predecessor .   .   .  well , it's hard to say .  i gave the first " scream " 3 1/2 stars as well because it worked pretty consistently as a light-hearted send-up .   " scream 2 " bounces all over the place stylistically , but it does a better job delivering the genuine scares and asking the questions about media violence that were only hinted at in the first installment .  i'm not sure which is the better movie , but i did leave the theater convinced of one thing : sequels , however much randy might argue , do not necessarily suck .

"  apparently , crime in the bronx has gotten so bad that the residents have actually taken to ritually decapitating one another for entertainment .  but , even in the film's darkest moments , fate conveniently lends a hand , supplying heavily armored transportation and easily accessible rifles and dynamite .  yes , in the future , man may travel to space and conquer mars , but nothing beats a good stick of tnt .  and as we all know , every police station , past , present , or future , keeps a healthy supply on hand .  characters die , heads are lopped off , but they were only supporting roles anyway , so why should we care ?  as long as you have plenty of narcotics , immunity is guaranteed .  eventually though , even the most well-trained zombie alien gets a bit uppity and needs to be taught a lesson .  what better way than by sacrificing a few minor characters to a convenient nuclear detonation , killing anything the machine guns can't handle .  explosions are fun .  and even if the nukes don't get them , the conveniently placed dynamite packs on the train stolen from the set of the road warrior certainly will .  in the end this film defines itself when our cop's tribunal pronounces , " is that all you have to tell us ? "  for , indeed , john carpenter has run out of things to say , and has instead decided to use whatever is convenient to tell a ridiculously bad story . 
pos@ pos neg notting hill's trailer is awful : a laughless , schmaltzy montage .  the movie was desperately marketed to the anti-phantom menace crowd , the same lovelorn females who ignored the love letter .  and it apparently worked .  perhaps the presence of julia roberts-whose allure beyond those perfect teeth still escapes me-had a lot to do with notting hill's opening weekend success , but the film's staying power is based on word of mouth .  allow me to spread some more good buzz for notting hill .  grant stars as william thacker , a travel-bookstore owner who works and resides in a tiny english district called notting hill .  into his shop one day wanders famous actress anna scott ( roberts ) .  a common thief , some spilled orange juice , and some stilted conversation leads to their first , highly impetuous ( or is that improbable ? ) , kiss .  days later , william sneaks into her hotel suite under the guise of a magazine journalist , and so begins a passionate , albeit surreptitious , affair .   ( aside : notting hill's portrayal of press junkets is deadly accurate . )  only anna's celebrity-or william's lack thereof-threatens to drive a wedge between them .  richard curtis has tapped into fantasy we all have considered , and for at least its first half-hour the picture's " beauty and the beast " -like scenario is ( romantic ) escapism of the highest order .  as with groundhog day or pleasantville , while watching the high-concept comedy notting hill one constantly imagines him/herself in the lead ; it's william's ordinaryness that entices the spoiled and bored anna .  curtis ( who previously penned four weddings and a funeral ) is also smart enough to know that the unlikely couple's situation is not enough to fuel two hours' worth of entertainment , so some of notting hill's finest moments revolve around william's eccentric friends and family .  by now , dear reader , you've probably heard a lot about rhys ifans' performance as william's imbecilic welsh flatmate .  yes , he's a crowd pleaser , a walking sight gag , but his character is not nearly as involving as the wheelchair-bound ( and appropriately named ) bella ( mckee , the anguished waitress of naked ) or max ( tom mcinnerny ) , her lousy chef of a husband .  in the movie's best sequence , william , anna , and company sit around bloated from max's latest concoction and hold a contest : the last brownie on the table goes to the diner with the saddest life .  the scene ends only as a british writer would end it .  if anything , fantastic bits like these dull the main plot's dramatic impact .  roberts and grant , especially , are appealing , but their relationship is convolutedly interrupted too many times ( four weddings' suffered similar flaws ) , and william and anna ultimately only have one thing in common : they're lonely .   ( worth noting in roberts' and grant's favour : the ubiquitous " i'm just a girl , standing across from a boy , asking him to love her " episode is not nearly so syrupy as it appears in clips , and it features some of the best emoting either actor has ever done . )  notting hill is nonetheless enjoyable ; on the visual side of things , i especially appreciated michell's playful changing-of-the-seasons number .  if only ( and this is a surprisinly minor gripe ) he had lopped off the egregious epilogue ; for a story that thrives on what we bring to it , the filmmakers work too hard to tidy things up , leaving our imaginations in the lurch . 
neg@ pos neg georges polti once wrote a paper called " the thirty-six dramatic situations , " in which he asserted the fact that all drama could be defined by no more than thirty-six different situations .  this may be the modern restatement of the biblical prophecy from ecclesiastes , " there's nothing new under the sun . "  the faculty , the latest movie by from dusk till dawn director robert rodriguez , certainly proves this in typical hollywood fashion .  there's not a measureable fraction of original material in this unworthy outing .  drawing elements from both the puppet masters and invasion of the body snatchers , screenwriter kevin williamson ( of scream 2 credit ) gives us a horror tale set in middle america ( ohio ) one eventful fall .  making use of a cast of unusually stock characters , williamson designs an alien invasion that will not be done independence day-style but rather " through the back door . "  parasitic aliens take over the faculty of a run-down high school and soon have infested most of the student body , leaving it up to the ensemble of principal characters to win the day .  the lack of gusto is the movie's major stumbling block .  even though the genre has seen movies that have a lack for quality such as this , they've been saved by an energetic approach .  this casts more than a shadow of a doubt on williamson's ability , who enjoyed success with the wes craven-directed scream but couldn't pull anything solid in for this outing or i know what you did last summer .  although he designs the faculty with more of a sci-fi bent than his typical slasher picture , it still comes down to the same results : throw the stock characters in a steel cage match and see who comes out alive .  on that level , the main roles are played by virtual unknowns .  only the recognizeable elijah wood ( deep impact ) is at the front ; other than that , the screen veterans are saved for the minor roles of the alien teachers .  perhaps williamson has it in mind to champion these up-and-comers to the fame that their scream and last summer counterparts achieved ; but to do that , they'd all need to star in their own wb television show about the horrors of puberty a la " dawson's creek . "  needless to say the acting is far from top notch , nor does necessity ask that it should be .  there is a moment or two of genuine horror , but unfortunately williamson and rodriguez did not take the story far enough in the sci-fi direction to make any use of it .  in sum , the faculty was just one long shot that did not pay off . 
pos@ pos neg i've never been a member of the robin williams fan club .  a little bit of his improvisationaly schtick goes a long way , and i sometimes feel as though i'm watching a 40-year-old class clown .  in his films , williams has often tried to balance his mania with touchy-feely emotion , leading to wildly uneven performances .  mrs .  doubtfire seemed ready-made for the same problems , but instead it proves to be williams' best comic screen project yet .  while it still contains some characteristic self-indulgence , mrs .  doubtfire is nonetheless an engaging belly-laugh comedy served up with high energy .  williams stars as daniel hillard , a cartoon voiceover artist with a penchant for irresponsible behavior .  one such incident proves one too many for wife miranda ( sally field ) , and she files for a divorce .  unemployed , living in a disastrously unkempt apartment and faced with limited time with his three beloved children , daniel decides to respond to miranda's ad for an afternoon housekeeper .  he turns to his brother frank ( harvey fierstein ) , a theatrical makeup artist , and emerges as euphegenia doubtfire , a matronly 65-year-old englishwoman .  daniel uses his access to the house to keep an eye on miranda's flirtation with a wealthy client ( pierce brosnan ) , to spend time with the children , and to learn something about responsible parenting , all the while trying to keep his identity hidden from the people who know him best .  mrs . doubtfire has to overcome a mountain of implausibilities to work , and basically it does so .  the most crucial is that no one in the family recognizes daniel , and thanks to the fantastic special makeup that's instantly believable .  it may be one of the most convincing transformations ever committed to film , making dustin hoffman's dorothy michaels look like milton berle .  more problematic was a series of calls daniel makes to miranda posing as nannies from hell ; it's a bit hard to swallow that she doesn't recognize any of the voices as her husband's .  perhaps the biggest contrivance we're asked to swallow is that daniel could make a quick change into mrs . doubtfire in a few minutes .  there's more to realistic makeup than slapping on a latex mask .  fortunately , these are inconsistencies which only attract attention as the credits roll .  during the film , i was generally too busy laughing .  after getting off to a slow start involving too much of williams' riffing , mrs .  doubtfire kicks into high gear once the wig and pads are in place .  daniel's frantic attempt to fool a court officer is wonderful , as is the climactic restaurant sequence , even though i saw the resolutions coming a mile away .  clearly , most of the credit for doubtfire's success goes to robin williams .  it took putting him in drag , but for once he plays a comic character that isn't just robin williams with a different name .  he thoroughly inhabits euphegenia doubtfire , and seems to relish the scenes in which he gets to play her as blunt and foul-mouthed .  wisely , he never aims for saintly .  his responses to the intrusion of new suitor stu are often petty , but the kind of thing most of us might do with the benefit of anonymity .  it's one of mrs .  doubtfire's charms that neither daniel nor miranda is perfect , just people trying to be better .  as miranda , sally field is solid in a background role , and pierce brosnan is nicely understated as stu .  the children are also good , although mara wilson is almost oppressively cute as the youngest .  the supporting players merely step aside and allow williams to do his thing .  it's easy to see mrs .  doubtfire as little more than tootsie warmed over , and it's true that there are both broad themes and specific details in common .  but mrs .  doubtfire manages to carve out its own space , particularly through the surprisingly honest moments involving a judge's decision and the ultimate status of daniel and miranda's relationship .  there's nothing dazzlingly new in mrs .  doubtfire , but there are plenty of laughs , and good comedies are always in short supply .  and it's nice to see robin williams just act for a change . 
neg@ pos neg years ago , robin williams made _jumanji_ , a brilliant achievement in special effects , but a travesty on nearly every other level .  the same can be said for _what dreams may come_ , a boring , illogical , weepie-wannabe that left my senses numb .  don't get me wrong : i love breathtaking special effects and pulse-pounding imagery .  _brazil_ is on my personal top ten .  _the city of lost children_ is a great film because of its outlandish scenarios .  i even love _2001_ and _last year at marienbad_ , being in the minority amidst my friends .  _what dreams may come_ , imagery aside , has little daring thought to complement its imagery .  the daring thought it _does_ have is never fully realized .  it's idea of a plot is so lukewarm , that it insults the bigger questions it raises .  it would have been better if the filmmakers rid the film of the live action sequences , put on an electronica soundtrack , and sell it as one of those popular _mind's eye_ videos .  robin williams plays chris nielsen , who dies too prematurely--not only in the story , but before we have a chance to really know and care for him .  the director , vincent ward , and the screenwriter ronald bass , have chosen to tell his life story in flashbacks while having the foreground story focus on his experience with the afterlife .  big mistake .  it would have been far better to take the half-hour or so needed to tell his life story first ( ala _it's a wonderful life_ ) , so that i can build up respect for him , so i could know and possibly care for him , his children , and his long-suffering wife ( played superbly by annabella sciorra ) .  instead , the filmmakers insult my intelligence by rushing into the story , expecting that the film to grow in depth as it progresses .  it doesn't .  so in the afterlife , chris learns that ( a ) people still don't meet god , ( b ) that our thoughts are reality , and ( c ) time does not exist there .  hmm . . .  i+ll grant one of those silly giant ideas for the sake of the narrative .   ( the " not meeting god " part still irks at me , but perhaps there was no possible way to film it and give it due respect ) .  that said , this alternate reality still makes no possible sense .  read on . . .  chris' wife commits suicide .  since suicides go to hell , chris would be separated from his wife forever .  the important question is , is heaven really heaven if you are separated from the one you love ?  good question .  and i like good thought-provoking questions .  i don+t like it when the filmmakers deviate from the question .  i _loathe_ it when the filmmakers deviate from the question so that the film becomes a popular rescue film , especially a rescue film which does not take its underlying premise seriously .  i _really_ loathe it when it+s story is no longer run by logic , but by special effects .  hey chris : did you forget ?  your thoughts are _real_ .  they are more _real_ than the physical world , according to the new-age screenplay .  so , why don+t you conjure up positive thoughts of annie , and let that run wild ?  and then she would appear before you , and you two would live in happy bliss for eternity ?  because there would be no movie , that+s why .  and albert the angel ( played by miscast cuba gooding , jr . ) says bluntly : " that+s fantasy . "  umm . . .  if your thoughts are more real than the physical , then fantasy is not fantasy , but real .  surely some eastern meditation specialist would be able to tell you that .  and if you happen to think that you are an unimaginative person , and that your thoughts aren't big enough to sustain you for eternity , well , in all due respect , that's why i don't subscribe to this theology .  all due respect .  another idea , based on " time , ( pause ) , does not exist here ! "  so chris , spend your eternity with annie , as she is on earth , reliving your favorite memories , or hang out with her when she was growing up .  you+ve got eternity : perhaps you can hang around long enough and learn not to freak her out .  and forcing her to write " i still exist " in her diary , imo , is just too tacky .  there are many other ideas , all of which are a hundred times better than what+s unraveled in the plot .  the great aforementioned question is sidetracked into gimmicky subplots that have been done before , and just come out stale .  most insulting is the subplot where important people in chris+ life appear in heaven differently than he expects , so when they finally show themselves , he realizes they were with him all along .  and when this happens , the film runs in slow motion , as if to build emotion .  _gag me with a spoon_ .  so the only things for me to like are sciorra+s effective performance , who rises far above this mundane material , and the special effects .  please note that while i enjoyed some of the visuals , i did not enjoy _all_ of them : some of the images looked like sandy duncan universe , everybody floating up and down in invisible strings .  it sounds like a joke , but it+s really true : i really tried to block out the dialogue , and figure out what music would best work as an alternative soundtrack .  my vote goes to a rare cd called " never say die " ( 1981 ) from petra , a christian rock group .  it+s pretty good , and they have a song about annie , who commits suicide .   ( it+s too late for annie/she+s gone away for good/there+s so much we'd have told her/and now we wish we could/but it+s too late . . . ) .  melancholic , yes .  depressing , yes .  but far more entertaining . . .  so , in case you don+t know , let me be straight .  suicide--bad .  _don+t do it_ .  no . no . no .

pos@ pos neg in chocolat , a chocolate shop owner tells her customers to look into a spinning object of obscure textures , patterns , and lines , hoping she'll be able to foresee the kind of chocolate they'll most enjoy .  some scoff the idea , but everyone who gazes into the complexity of the spinning object winds up seeing something different than the next , revealing personality traits which the person may not have known they had before .  this can easily stand as a model for chocolat as a whole : on the surface , it appears to be a light , fluffy fable with no depth or true worth , but when one takes a second , deeper look , chocolat's true colors begin to shine through .  making a bold statement about organized religion and those who practice it , lasse hallstrom's chocolat is flawlessly acted and meticulously crafted-not to mention one of the best films of the year .  what gives chocolat its magic , much like hallstrom's 1999 winner of two academy awards , the cider house rules , is its willingness to say what's on its mind without holding back to prevent offending audiences .  the bold and honest message hallstrom conveys with chocolat will no doubt outrage a select group of viewers , but those who are willing to suspend their bitterness because they feel they are being intimidated or attacked should find themselves to be in agreement with what the film says about narrow-mindedness .  chocolat centers its story around the small french village of lansquenet , where majority rules , and the majority lives by only one law : religion .  the bulk of the townspeople ( with few exceptions ) are preparing for the sacred time of abstinence , lent , but when the independent thinking , seemingly non-religious vianne rocher ( juliette binoche ) and her daughter anouk ( victoire thivisol ) make the village their home , the people will be tempted beyond belief by the mouth-watering confections in the chocolate shop vianne opens .  many are predictably opposed and deeply offended by vianne's opening of the chocolate shop just in time for lent , especially the mayor , comte de reynaud ( a cartoon-like alfred molina ) , who will stop at nothing to put her out of business .  on the other hand , the shop is a delight to others , including the cranky armande voizin ( judi dench ) , who sits day by day in vianne's shop , telling the single mother about her unfortunate detached relationship with her grandson ( aurelien parent-koening ) , which comes as a result of his mother ( carrie-ann moss ) believing armande is a bad influence , as she does not hold the same , strict religious beliefs that she does .  also a fan of the chocolate is the nervous wreck josephine muscat , whose husband is constantly beating her , to whom vianne offers a home and befriends .  juliette binoche is charming and honest as vianne , genuinely capturing her character's determination to turn the narrow-minded townspeople into more happy , independent human beings , but most of chocolat's success is unquestionably a result of the remarkable performances of the supporting actresses .  lena olin , previously nominated for an oscar in 1989 , deserves her second nomination for her earnest , moving portrayal of a lost , scared woman torn between staying true to her battering , manipulative husband or leaving him to live the life which for which she longs .  judi dench is sharp , incisive , and occasionally greatly touching as armande voizin .  carrie ann-moss , in what is likely to be her first largely noticed ( and acclaimed ) role since the matrix , shows a more solid side of her acting skills not previously seen , crafting a character that the viewer both sympathizes with and despises simultaneously .  victoire thivisol shows much promise as anouk , a young girl hoping her always-on-the-move mother will eventually settle down .  a trade ad for chocolat sums up best the power the actresses have on screen with the tagline : " five extraordinary women , one extraordinary movie . "  that's not to say the men don't do their share , though : alfred molina makes for a sly and utterly repugnant antagonist , hugh o'conor adds quite a bit of comic relief as the priest who seems to not even know why he is who he is , and johnny depp gives a strong performance as the pirate roux , who enters the film late in the game and sparks the romantic interest of vianne .  the technical aspects of chocolat are strong across the board : lasse hallstrom directs his enchanting fable with great care , perfectly balancing the elements of each genre to be found within the film .  cinematographer roger pratt brings an atmospheric , fairy tale look to the film , and rachel portman's masterful score is her best and most memorable since the cider house rules .  chocolat , adapted by robert nelson jacobs from the joanne harris novel , is a wonderful little treat of a film , one that will most likely win over the hearts of audiences and the votes of academy members this winter , and the aggressive backing of miramax films assures the latter .  while not as powerful as the cider house rules , lasse hallstrom's chocolat is a film which works on all levels-as a drama , a comedy , a fable , a romance , and a fairy tale .  and it even lives up to its name : it is delicious to savor the taste of , easy to digest , and , like all excellent chocolate , it is memorable for days afterward .  the bottom line : chocolat is pure pleasure . 
neg@ pos neg working in the motion picture industry must be a constant source of frustration for a front-line african american actress like jada pinkett smith .  despite being one of the freshest talents available , pinkett smith has often been relegated to playing thankless supporting parts ( a low down dirty shame , the nutty professor ) .  the problem is , of course , that there aren't many good roles available for black women .  take away the likes of waiting to exhale , set it off , soul food , and eve's bayou , and all that's left is a chance to be someone's girlfriend , a local whore , or a murder victim .  as a result , for pinkett smith's first opportunity atop the marquee , she is stuck in a stupid , formulaic romantic comedy with the unpromising title of woo .  actually , woo , the latest directorial effort from daisy v . s .  mayer ( party girl ) , could have been worse than it is .  the film offers a few funny ( albeit juvenile ) moments and the on-screen relationship between pinkett smith's woo and tommy davidson's tim is appealing on those rare occasions when the two aren't forced to play it dumb for the sake of an endless barrage of cheap gags .  unfortunately , huge portions of the movie are insulting to the intelligence of anyone with a triple-digit i . q .  the situations are painfully contrived , the main characters are lifted right out of sit-coms , and the supporting players are so incredibly stupid that i wondered whether they all participated in some kind of " free lobotomy " lab experiment .  woo is a spontaneous , energetic young woman who has been looking for love in all the wrong places .  her latest relationship , with a testosterone-overdosed drug-dealer , came to an abrupt end when she refused to wear a beeper .  now , her transvestite/medium friend celestrial ( girlina ) predicts that she's about to meet mr . right , and that he'll be a virgo .  later that day , woo is given an opportunity to go out on a blind date with tim , a shy man with a penchant for neatness and order , who just happens to be a virgo .  it's not love at first sight , however .  things get off to a rocky start when tim makes an awkward pass , and they get even worse when the pair arrives at a swanky restaurant to enjoy a " quiet " dinner .  in the one-hundred year history of motion pictures , there have been a ton of bad " white " movies about mismatched lovers , so i suppose it's only fair that we get a " black " effort of the same low caliber .  as in all romantic comedies , we know from the beginning that woo and tim are going to end up together .  the question is , are their courtship rituals entertaining ?  in a good entry to the genre , the audience becomes caught up in the love story , no matter how familiar it is .  in woo , the constant reliance upon unfunny , moronic humor sinks the project .  for those who enjoy spotting continuity gaffes , there's a huge one in woo involving a corvette with a broken window that miraculously repairs itself ( added to that is the mystery of how the car looses its top ) .  sadly , that's one of the film's most enjoyable sequences , and the entertainment value is entirely unintentional .  despite exuding charm from every pore , there's little that pinkett smith and davidson can do to save their characters or david c . johnson's script .  since it misses the mark by so much , a better name for woo might have been whoops . 
pos@ pos neg what if one of our cities became the target for terror ?  what can we do ?  what can america really do about the increasing threat of terrorism ?  what basic human rights are we willing to sacrifice to prevent another oklahoma city disaster ?  so far america has been the leading nation , opposing the fundamentalist terrorists around the world .  it is the land of opportunities .  it is the land of freedom .  but what if it became the new target ?  this dark fantasy has unfortunately a very strong grounding in reality .  when a special branch of the united states military , under the command of general william devereaux ( bruce willis ) , takes prisoner suspected terrorist mastermind sheik ahmed bin talal , islamic fundamentalists across the world take notice .  the only warning the fbi receives is a single , cryptic message : " release him . "  then all hell breaks loose in new york .  a bus is destroyed , killing 25 civilians .  a broadway theater is bombed .  hostages are taken at a school .  as the wave of terrorist activity crests , the president must consider if the only way to save the city and break the grip of fear is to declare martial law .  devereaux argues against that eventuality , but is nevertheless ready to lead 10 , 000 men into action on american soil .  another person not in favor of martial law is anthony hubbard ( denzel washington ) , the fbi agent in charge of investigating the terrorist activities .  his staff is comprised of smart , energetic , intelligent men and women very much unlike the usual group o !  f moronic feds we're used to seeing in movies .  hubbard develops an uneasy alliance with cia agent elise kraft ( annette bening ) , whose department knows more about the situation than they're willing to reveal .  but the attacks escalate .  the fbi are helpless , chasing an invisible enemy .  the land is under siege .  they have lost control . . a  terror is coming from within . .  what's great about this film is that it is made as if holding up a mirror to life .  it reflects reality .  and that's why it makes such an impact .  edward zwick has created a clever , well written and terrifying thriller that may very well be one of the best films of the season .  the director manages to tell several stories simultaneously .  and so his film plays on several levels , never loosing focus on its main objective .  he is exploring the abuse of power , the distrustful relationships that exist between various segments of the u . s . government ( the army , the fbi , and the cia ) .  he takes a look at the complexities inherent when so many secrets and lies are involved .  the palestinian community in 1998 new york is treated exactly as japanese americans were during world war ii .  there are concentration camps and unlawful interments , all in the name of the " greater good . "  in the latter part of the film the land of opportunities looses its heart and soul -- freedom .  was that what the terror !  ists really wanted ?  this film has evoked protests and objections from the arab-american population in the u . s . and n . y . especially .  but to me these protests seem unnecessary .  zwick is careful to not step over the line and make the palestinians typical hollywood bad guys .  the script is therefore wonderfully balanced .  agent hubbard's best friend and loyal colleague frank haddad ( tony shalhoub ) is lebanese-american .  and it is quite often you hear lines such as " my first boyfriend was palestinian .  they seduce you with their suffering " or " they love this country as much as we do . "  but no matter how you twist this matter , you won't get away from the fact that when it comes to world wide terrorism it is arab-speaking population who are in the great majority .  more to the point , the siege demonstrates the injustice of blanket condemnation of any ethnic group by depicting the unfair treatment of all arab-americans by the u . s . military .  and thus this film does not serve as a source for discrimination in any !  way .  denzel washington is dashing as always .  in this role he is much more determined and stronger than usual .  anette bening is enjoyable and believable as a shadowy cia operative who prefers espionage , a network of snitches and seduction to gather information . .  bruce willis is terrifying as the sadist , hungry for power , that never looses his connection with the audience , since his point of view is not too hard to understand .  the film is elegantly shaped .  the scenes are easily floating into each other and the film never seems overlong .  zwick knows exactly how to provoke tension , horror and emotions and does it with a rarely observed professionalism .  he tightens the intensity as the events progress .  and when a plot twist comes , it actually is surprising .  it is not a film drained in patriotism , like the work of roland emerich .  nor is it a film that portrays explosions purely for entertainment values .  it is a daring picture that has courage enough to undertake such a risky story and difficult journey .  it has courage enough to get involved in politics .  it questions our foreign policies , mentality and defense .  i must admit that it ends rather disappointing , as the director turns the patriotism way up and innovation down .  but despite of that , it is certainly an intelligent and thrilling film that provokes emotions and thoughts ; a virtue that few summer films can boast of .   " this is the u . s . army .  it's a broadsword , not a scalpel .  believe me , you do not want us in an american city " - gen . william devereaux , " the siege "

pos@ pos neg earlier this year , the movie holy man opened to a meager box office receipt and to indifference from audiences and critics .  a real charmer of a movie , it's possible that the subject matter was too hip or trendy to attract any real audience .  now , at the end of 1998 , comes waking ned devine , a comedy which inspires the same vein of easygoing laughter .  there's no substantial difference between the two other than a more refined atmosphere -- they strike all the same chords -- but still , ned devine is a movie worth seeing .  the plot is interesting and robust : the latest lottery winner is ned devine ( jimmy keogh ) , of tullymore , ireland .  ned's prize is over six million pounds , but the shock of winning killed the poor old man , and the check remains unclaimed .  enter jackie o'shea ( ian bannen ) and michael o'sullivan ( david kelly ) , the only two residents who are aware the winner is in their village .  the two men eventually find the ticket , and decide that if michael can convince the lotto authorities that he's actually ned , the entire town can reap the benefits ; their only adversary is an ancient old woman ( eileen dromey ) who sees more profit in reporting the fraud .  ian bannen and david kelly truly shine as jackie and michael .  jackie , stocky and large , is the brains behind the operation ; michael , scrawny and short , is the method man .  the two contrast each other delightfully , and at the same time remain sympathetic to the audience .  every viewer is sure to like both of them .  there are other minor subplots included as well , such as an unlikely romance between a local girl and the town pig farmer .  this appears quite inconsequential until the end , and even with a startling revelation it's a tad bit unnecessary .  overall , waking ned devine has a predictable outcome , and plot twists are never really taken seriously .  the ending , a very hilarious and very ironic twist of fate , somehow fits with the twisted sense of humor the movie exhibits throughout .  the kirk jones script is indeed off-the-cuff .  in a way , waking ned devine is exactly like the class of people it presents : warm , friendly , outgoing , and jovial .  it's the perfect kind of comedy , a real gem of a tale that sets up a trivial plot outline by which to introduce a sympathetic cast of characters and a string of jokes .  there's nothing remotely serious or grounded for more than a moment or two , because the spirit of ned devine is a lighthearted one .  indeed , it's one of the year's best feel-good movies -- 91 minutes of unrestrained joy that no one should miss .

" never do your own stash " , warns one character early in the film .  as sure as night follows day , the emperor of miami eventually falls .  writer oliver stone and director brian de palma make an explosive combination here .  stone's script offers solid storytelling and some fine character development .  montana is fascinating ; uneducated but calculating , a straight shooter who speaks from the heart ; an ambitious , violent man yet one with a conscience .  a man fiercely protective of his beautiful 20 year old sister , not wanting her to be sucked into the glitzy , dangerous world which he inhabits .  pacino is dynamite , taking to the role with a brooding , bristling energy which in his more recent films has often degenerated into just simple overracting .  pfeiffer also registers strongly as the gangstar mole with no inner life .  only once does tony express real affection for her and his desire to have children , and even then you sense all he really wants is a regular screw and a beautiful object to show off to his friends , and she's happy to oblige .  this isn't as meaty a role for pfieffer as sharon stone's was in casino , but its an effective one nonetheless and she aquits herself well .  as director , de palma sets up a number of dramatic scenes with his typical stylistic brauva .  the escalating tension he creates in various mob situations - a drug deal gone wrong , an assination attempt - is often thrilling , and in this respect he is every bit the equal of scorese and coppola .  where he differs from , say , coppola's godfather trilogy is in his overall treatment .  coppola gives his crime sagas an operatic sweep , whereas in scarface de palma opts for a grittier feel .  and it perfectly suits the material .  the only major botch is giorgio moroder's mostly crap synthesier score .  it's just not right , and unfortunately compromises the impact of some otherwise good scenes .  as expected , scarface is very violent at times , but you shouldn't be watching gangster movies if that upsets you .  at over two and a half hours in length it's a true epic , and if you're a fan of the genre you'll love f * * k-filled minute of it . 
neg@ pos neg this is the kind of movie that makes one appreciate disney's live- action george of the jungle .  tarzan and the lost city , the latest attempt to bring edgar rice burrough's legendary hero to the big screen , is one of the most inept and ill-timed of any tarzan adventure so far .  badly conceived and poorly executed , tarzan and the lost city appears headed for a quick trip to video store shelves .  i have no idea why the producers chose now to bring back tarzan ; it's not as if there are legions of new fans clamoring for his next movie .  furthermore , it's even more curious that this film is rated pg , which , by definition , rules out any sex or explicit violence .  and , while i'm not advocating the excesses embraced by the 1981 bo derek version of the story , tarzan deserves a slightly more adult approach than the one used in the embarrassing production .  of course , no tweaking of the content to change the rating could have saved tarzan and the lost city , since the film's troubles originated with the script and were propagated all the way down the line .  imagine george of the jungle stripped of all ( intentional ) humor , and you have a fair idea of what this tarzan is like .  with its uninspired action and tepid adventure sequences , the film barely registers a pulse .  anyone in search of a relatively entertaining , family jungle adventure should check out the 1994 version of the jungle book , which uses the same basic elements to much better effect .  the only worthwhile element of tarzan and the lost city is the pretty scenery ( which , unfortunately , includes the two lead actors ) .  the film doesn't attempt to re-tell the origin story ? the thinking is that it has been done often enough .  instead , tarzan and the lost city introduces us to lord graystoke a . k . a . john clayton a . k . a . tarzan the ape man ( casper van dien ) several days before his marriage to lady jane porter ( jane march ) .  he is living happily in england , enjoying the benefits of being a land-owning noble .  meanwhile , in central africa , the dastardly nigel ravens ( steven waddington ) , a self-proclaimed scholar and explorer , believes he has found the way to the lost city of opar , which he calls the cradle of civilization .  on the way there , he and his band of mercenaries do all sorts of nasty things , like burning native villages , to earn the wrath of the locals .  one shaman , determined to stop ravens from unearthing opal , sends a mystical message to tarzan for help .  with lady jane following close behind , he returns to the jungle where he was born .  its patently obvious that casper van dien ( one of the pretty-boy heroes of starship troopers ) was not hired on the basis of his acting ability .  with his plastic facial expressions , monotone voice , and complete inability to make convincing animal noises , his range rivals that of steven seagal .  his pecs , however , are impressive , and director carl schenkel makes sure that he is given every opportunity to show them off .  jane march , on the other hand , has to keep her shirt on , which may be a first for her .  some six years ago , march give a solid performance in jean jacques annaud's steamy the lover .  since then , she made the career-killing decision of appearing opposite bruce willis in the color of night , which exploited her every acting defiency .  tarzan continues this trend .  march may be attractive , but , at least judging by this performance , she can't act .  meanwhile , steven waddington has serious trouble summoning up the menace necessary to be a really detestable bad guy .  instead , he turns out to be little more than a nuisance .  the story line is pure formula , which has largely been true throughout the years for almost all of the tarzan movies .  the problem is that this one seems so childish and lifeless .  the romantic elements are all contrived ? in fact , lady jane's presence is necessary only so she can be captured and subsequently rescued by her buff fiance .  the special effects are truly bottom-of-the-barrel ( including some laughably bad men in ape costumes ? apparently , animatronics were too expensive for this production ) .  and , of course , as with all jungle movies , there are the obligatory cute animals .  over the years , the legend of tarzan has been one of the most popular sources for film series material .  the most famous ape man was johnny weismuller , but no less than two dozen other actors have essayed the part ( including gordon scott , who is widely believed to be the best actor to tackle the role ) .  weismuller made 12 tarzan features ; van dien will probably fall 11 short of that number .  and , having seen tarzan and the lost city , i would argue that the movie-going public would have been well served if he had missed by 12 . 
pos@ pos neg this sunday afternoon i had the priviledge of attending a private screening at the sony astor cinema in new york city , of james cameron's most heralded film , titanic .  postponed from last summer , with an escalated budget that makes it the most expensive movie in history , this was one film i was eager to preview .  so , is this movie going to sink or swim this holiday ?  my best guess . . . . it will sink , though with many awards attatched to its hull .  no doubt , titanic is the most elaborate disaster movie ever made .  it boasts the most amazing effects that i have ever seen done to date .  to see a ship fall apart , with actual people running across the ship , flying across the deck , and falling to the water , is just amazing to look at .  the effects are so stunningly realistic , you would swear you were looking at actual footage .  but titanic is more than a disaster movie , and that's where the problem lies .  there is a love story attatched that nearly ruins the entire premise .  i'll give a capsule summary of the story without spoiling anything for you :  the film begins with a modern day excavation of sorts of the sunken titanic .  we see actual footage of the sunken ship , as cammeron had set up special cameras to film the wreckage on the ocean floor .  bill paxton leads the expedition , in search of sunken treasure .  what he finds instead , leads him to a mysterious old woman who recounts her tale of the titanic voyage .  we meet rose ( kate winslet ) , a young woman , who comes from an upper-class family .  rose is to be wed to a man she does not love .  we meet jack ( leonardo dicaprio ) , a young man , who comes from a poor financial background , and wins a ticket aboard the titanic , in a poker game .  the two meet under interesting circumstances , and the love story begins .  add in a jealous fiance , and a not-so-nice law officer played by david warner , and you have a story that , well , gets a bit overplayed and oversappy .  i must add , at this point , that the most likeable character in the movie is played by kathy bates , as a woman with " new money " who is a lot less uptight than the other rich folk on the ship .  she is a pleasure to see on screen .  when the ship does hit the iceberg at exactly 1 : 40 into the film , and eventually sinks , you never really feel for any of these characters .  the film is just loaded with unlikeable rich snobs and other folk you never really get a grasp on .  the effects are tremendous .  from the roars of gears and pumps in the engine room , to a doomed ship cracking at the seams , this is an effects picture that looks and sounds like no other .  we saw titanic in dolby digital surround , and by far , it is the best sounding movie i have ever seen .  my friend commented it was the best sound mix he has ever heard .  when people are in the water , at film's end , you are surrounded by the voices of lost soles .  titanic runs far too long .  the movie is 3 hours and 15 minutes in length .  and , while most of the first 2 . 5 hours runs very fast and well-paced , the final 45 minutes almost comes to a sudden stop , and you realize that this sappy love story has to finish itself out before the movie finally ends .  don't get me wrong about titanic . . . . it's  not a bad as i am making it out to be .  it really is an exceptionaly well-made film .  the costumes and sets are incredible , and true to the time period .  the ship is painstakingly created exactly true to form , as we see actual pictures of the modern-day wreckage , transformed into the movie depiction .  this film will certainly win on effects , costume , set design and sound .  cameron has certainly made his best film to date .  unfortunately , titanic is not a best picture candidate .  it just doesn't have a strong supporting story .  it's an exceptional disaster film with sappy filler inside .  it just doesn't have the emotional impact that i suspect mr . cameron was shooting for .  i predict that titanic will open to likeable reviews .  it is a film worth seeing .  i predict that it will only do moderately well at the box office .  with its extreme running time , and lack of enough robust to get substantial word-of-mouth , i expect that it will do even better on home video .  this will certainly be the definitive ac3 movie for all you home theater enthusiasts .  titanic opens december 19th , and is released by paramount pictures and twentieth century-fox .  i give titanic 3 stars ( .  that's not bad .  ron epstein  riginally posted in home theater forum === 
neg@ pos neg making your first feature film ain't easy .  assemble a decent , if not , strong cast , as writer/director robert moresco has done with one eyed king , and you're already ahead of the game .  but rehash old plot lines , tired dialogue , and standard clich ? s , and a well-intentioned effort such as this one could jeopardize your chance at a second feature film .  how many more movies do we need about a rough neighborhood full of lifelong friends hopelessly turned to crime or worse ?  the enormous catalog of such movies might dissuade a filmmaker from making yet another , but here we have it .  again .  five irish kids in nyc's hell's kitchen make an overemotional pact over some stolen rings on an anonymous rooftop .  with teary music .  and slow motion .  in the film's first scene .  the kids grow up to be fairly worthless adults , unable or unwilling to make their way out of the heat of the kitchen .  leading the clueless pack is william baldwin as a good-hearted guy who watches out for his buddies and is in tight with local mob head armand assante .  i'd like to say that his character gets involved over his head in some sort of blah , blah , blah , but all we seem to get are little tastes of possible plot points .  he's concerned about buddy jason gedrick's heroin abuse .  he sticks up for jim breuer after he impregnates baldwin's character's sister .  he looks into who might be pushing the most moronic-looking counterfeit cash ever made ( a genuinely funny touch ) .  but none of this ever really amounts to anything .  it seems that moresco's greater concern is to provide that intangible " slice of life " , that flavor of the neighborhood that everyone's been trying to evoke since scorsese's early work .  so , we get the drunk guys , hugging and singing together at the local bar , to prove to us that they really love each other .   ( do people actually do this ! ? )  we get a lot of tough street talk -- usually mumbled for effect -- and a whole lot of the f-word , whether it sounds like it fits or not .  we also get a handful of good actors in small roles that seem to lack purpose .  bruno kirby , chazz palminteri , you know , guys you've seen in movies just like this one before .  assante is intelligent casting as the man that everyone fears , and baldwin's performance is adequate , but most of the rest of the cast jump into the tough guy persona so thoroughly that it's almost funny .  moresco , a theater guy and sometimes tv writer ( including the series falcone ) , obviously labored over this one as anyone might a first child , but the content is probably too personal .  as a result , the movie's style is heavy-handed , in need of a considerable amount of toning down .  nearly every time an action by the grown up gang recalls something they did as kids , moresco reminds us -- boy does he remind us .  with slow dissolves to the earlier scene , running in slow motion , complete with dialogue from the present , just in case we don't comprehend the link to the past .  moresco needs to either trust his audience's intelligence , or have more faith in his own presentation rather than beat us over the head with it .  his next project should have a little more personal distance , and a lot more subtlety .  if he actually gets that chance .  reviewed as part of our 2001 boston film festival coverage ( feature story coming soon ) . 
pos@ pos neg urban legend surprised me .  based on the last few films the genre has produced ( including but not exclusive to the likes of i know what you did last summer , disturbing behavior and the disappointing halloween : h20 ) , i was positive that i was in store for another mildly entertaining but silly and ultimately boring rehash of the scream phenomena .  thankfully , legend rose above it's soggy premise to become not only a hip , scary and stylish entertainment , but also what will probably become one of the best films of the year .  you're all familiar with the plot ; a bunch of overly horny teenagers get systematically slaughtered by a masked maniac who's identity is not revealed until the closing moments of the film when it turns out to be , you guessed it ; everybody's favorite veteran of the whodunit flicks . . . the  only person you didn't suspect !  however , just because legend doesn't really break any new ground as far as literary or even technical achievements go does not mean that it can't qualify as first-class entertainment .  it was , believe it or not , one of the funnest times i've had at the movies all year .  the thing is , i'm not really sure what made this particular stab ( pardon the pun ) at the genre seem so fresh and alive .  maybe it was the above-par performances by the movie's two leads ( jared leto and " cybil " actress alicia witt ) .  or , it could have been the on- target direction by jamie blanks .  more likely , though , it was because of the inspired premise .  i don't think i need to tell you that a killer hacking people up ala urban folklore is much more frightening than a killer fisherman .  urban legend begins with a sequence that reminded me of the classic scream opener , not so much in plotting as in attention to detail that makes for an absolutely chilling teaser for the rest of the film .  a pretty young coed is driving down a deserted road when ( gasp ! ) a gas problem ( hee-hee ) forces her to stop at an equally deserted gas station for a refill .  one problem , though .  would you want to stop at a station run by brad dourif ?  i thought not .  predictably , the attendant ends up coaxing her into the main building to sort out a problem with the credit card company .  it's odd , though , when you pick up a phone to realize that nobody's on the other line .  naturally , the potential victim escapes into her car and drives off .  and the when we least expect it . . . whack ! ! !  a decapitation .  it turns out that the creepy looking attendant was just trying to warn her about the maniac in the back seat of the car .  so who is it this time ?  the obvious candidate is the slightly off-kilter professor at the college the girl went to ( none other than freddy kruger himself , robert englund ) , who teaches a class on urban legends .  a-ha .  or could it be the fame-hungry local journalist ( leto ) looking for a meaty story to put on his resume ?  like all movies of this nature , one of the chief pleasures is trying to guess whodunit .  and it turns out to be , of course , the one you didn't suspect .  i'm not going to pretend urban legend is anything more than it is , but i must give credit where credit is due .  and this flick definitely deserves credit for being what not many other recent horror films have been . . . fun .   * complimentary movie ticket courtesy of valley cinemas in lodi , ca 
neg@ pos neg  * this review contains spoilers * as with most of her films , director amy heckerling's latest , loser , seesaws between unpleasant and artificial , and is sometimes both at once .  when she tackles big issues , such as abortion in fast times at ridgemont high , it's impossible to tell whether she's being matter-of-fact or glib about them ( they carry an almost documentary starkness ) , but whatever the case , she continually refuses to comment politically .  such is the sitcom tendency of her work : to jeopardize the innocence of her characters and then hit the reset button .  this fear of drama soured me on fast times . . . , look who's talking , clueless , and now loser , in which ms . heckerling also demonstrates , for the first time , zero affinity for the milieu .  has anyone , for instance , ever met a girl in the stylistic vein of mena suvari's dora ?  attired in black thrift , her eye shadow smeared to racoon chic and her bangy red hair barely contained by girlish clips , she accepts the label of goth , but no self-respecting goth girl ever admitted to digging , as dora does , those geriatric rockers everclear , nor willingly went anywhere with a six-pack-wielding fratboy stranger .  the mechanics of loser's tired old introvert-boy-falls-for-extrovert-girl plot drive its protagonists into cultural non-specificity , so that they become even less than stereotypes .  they become walking wardrobes .  small-town transplant paul ( a strangely static jason biggs ) , our eponymous hero , always wears his woolly hunter's cap with flaps covering the ears , and beneath it rests a parted moptop that couldn't scream " shemp " ( the lame stooge ) wig louder .  he has three smug-looking roommates ( the one-dimensional trio is not supposed to be brothers , but they share similar facial features , including and especially mouths ) , and their fashion sense is incomprehensibly glam .  though they're not overtly transvestites , heckerling seems to be equating flamboyance with villainy ; how very cruising of her .   ( the dormies conspire to evict paul and regularly molest women they have drugged .  dora ignorantly downs one of their date rape potions .  unfortunately , either heckerling or the studio is too cowardly to admit if she was subsequently violated . )  when paul rescues dora from said narcotic scare , he learns that she is dating their unctuous european lit professor edward alcott ( superb greg kinnear ) .  although paul's already in love with dora by this point , as is bound to happen to losers when pretty girls address them by name , he gets altruistic and pretends the flowers he bought her are actually from alcott .  she's thrilled , but nevertheless spends a few days at paul's to recuperate ; the two bond over emergency kitten surgery and a broadway play ( " cabaret " ) , and just when paul's got in his head that she's starting to love him back in that non-friendly way , she decides to become alcott's live-in girlfriend .  cue precious hommage to the graduate , shots of paul drifting around berkeley--er . . .   ( aside : simon & garfunkel's " parsley , sage , rosemary & thyme " should never have been allowed in another motion picture . )  heckerling has a lot in common with nora " you've got mail " ephron , the only other prominent chick directing comedies today , in that neither has any use for strong-willed women .  men continue to trod on dora until the bitter end ( in the final scene , she gives paul a big smooch after he blurts out his feelings in what amounts to a creepy ultimatum ) , and dora ultimately shrugs off being drugged against her will--mere hours after paul hints to her that she was poisoned , she's cheerily redecorating his apartment .   ( heckerling is so laissez-faire about the issue in general that she reserves the comeuppance of the would-be rapists for jokey epilogue titles . )  goth veneer aside , there are an awful lot of girls out there who behave as erratically as dora , and enough angry young dude filmmakers to make movies about them .  heckerling misses her shot at having dora transform herself into a role model , and while such arcs may not be heckerling's social responsibility , it is a privilege i would have taken advantage of if i were in her shoes .   ( consider , too , that dora is the film's sole female principal . )  not that loser is worth contemplating this seriously--god knows heckerling didn't .  that is her hallmark .

pos@ pos neg the postman delivers but not first class  the postman a film review by michael redman copyright 1997 by michael redman  [warning : my opinion of this film is definitely in the minority of reviewers perhaps because it hits so many of my cinematic buttons : post-apocalypse stories , hope in a desperate situation , grassroots uprisings and kevin costner .  even worse , i thought that " waterworld " was watchable .  read the following with those particular grains of salt . ]  it's the year 2013 and things have fallen apart .  due to a world war in the late nineties , the resulting three-year winter and a devastating plague , life in the former united states has been reduced to isolated primitive fiefdoms .  although this is the future , it looks like a western .  as the film opens , kevin costner ( his character's name is never revealed ) is wandering the utah wastelands with only his mule bill for company .  giving extraordinarily bad shakespearean performances in exchange for food and lodging , costner is an outsider in a land of outsiders .  running into even worse luck , he is forcibly conscripted into the racially pure holnist army of general bethlehem ( will patton ) .  the rag-tag retro-futuristic cavalry is the descendent of militia groups and is even called the " clan "  after a brutal boot camp , he ( and you can see this coming a mile away ) escapes .  taking shelter in a wrecked postal truck , he liberates the uniform and mail bag from the skeleton in the cab who no longer has a use for either .  once he reaches oregon , land of beautiful women , bright youngsters and rock and roll ; he pretends to be a representative from the " restored congress of the united states of america " .  this scam gets him inside the walled towns where the promise of mail delivery renews optimism in the hearts of the inhabitants .  food and other opportunities come his way in the form of spirited abby ( olivia williams ) who wants him to father a child because her husband is sterile .  shortly her husband is killed by bethlehem and she and the postman ( as costner is referred to for the rest of the film ) become a reluctant item .  although the postman knows he's running a fraud , the concept of renewed communications sets the kids' imagination afire ( especially ford lincoln mercury ( larenz tate ) , his second-in-command ) and they form a new pony express dedicated to getting the mail through .  the revived postal service doubles as an army to fight the holnists' tyranny .  the postman has become a symbol for hope in a rube goldberg manner .  although the movie appeals to my sensibilities , there are so many things wrong with it that they can hardly be counted .  it's derivitive of costner's own " waterworld " and clint eastwood westerns .  there's little here that we haven't seen dozens of times before .  the film is often down-right corny .  a scene where the postman is on horseback and grabs a letter from the hands of a bright-eyed child is embarrassing in its slow-motion banality .  the film's final few minutes should have been left on the cutting room floor .  despite the film's excessive three hour length , several things are never explained .  what was the war about ?  how did civilization change so rapidly ?  everyone has horses : where did all they come from ?  the " law of eights " that bethlehem lives by seems to have its origins somewhere beyond the film , but where ?  are we to believe that the rest of the world is in the same shape and hasn't made their way west to help or conquer ?  there is some jumbled symbolism here that doesn't appear to make sense .  the tale is obviously saying that communication can defeat evil in much the same way that the internet has the potential to topple governments , but beyond that there are some oddities .  the evil army is called " holnists " which sounds coincidentally like the new age " holism " , but why ?  is it another coincidence that it takes place in 2013 , just one year after many ancient prophesies ( including the ending of the mayan calendar ) predict a new world for mankind ?  why is the general named " bethlehem " ?  there seems to be some reason for that , but what ?  sometimes the movie feels like a joke .  an army of postal workers armed with guns ?  considering the headlines of recent years , it takes a tremendous leap of faith to cheer for these guys .  it's even more difficult to accept those re-powering the federal government as the heroes .  given the current climate of the country and the distrust of big government , it's asking a lot for the audience to get behind the film's nationalism .  even with its numerous flaws , the movie all comes together , if only for those who have the same weaknesses that i have .  it's doubtful that " the postman " is going to find much of an audience , but a few of us are going to have a good time .  besides we're all awaiting the fall of civilization caused by the year 2000 millennium computer bug .   ( michael redman has written this column for over 22 years and would like to announce that the " michael redman " arrested near indianapolis last week for accepting an illicit package from federal express is , to the best of his knowledge , not him .  perhaps this similarly-named person should have used kevin costner's postal service . ) 
neg@ pos neg  " return to horror high , " wants to be a couple different types of movies at once .  the film tells the story of a low-budget horror movie being filmed at the closed-down crippen high , a school where a group of serial murders took place five years before .  but what the cast and crew don't know is that a real killer , maybe the same one that was never apprehended , is going into action again .  on one level , " return to horror high " is a slasher movie , and it is at this level that it works the best on .  watching the film , which was made in 1987 , i couldn't help but take notice that the killer's costume was almost identital to that of the ghostface in , " scream , " and " scream 2 . "  on another level , the film wants to be a slapstick comedy , and there are many hints of this throughout .  unfortunately , most of these jokes fall flat .  and the last thing the film wants to be is a " behind-the-scenes " look at an exploitation film being made .  the only problem is that , while much of it is supposed to be from the movie itself being made , no cameras are shown filming it , thus making it far more confusing than it had to be .  and to top it all off , the " twist " ending makes very little to no sense whatsoever , and so we are basically left with feeling as if we wasted our time .  there are story developments that are beyond ludicrous , and plot holes you could drive a winnebago through .  if you see the film , or have seen it , you'll know what i mean .  the premise of " return to horror high , " is admittedly pretty crafty , and i liked the atmosphere of the school , which is where the whole thing takes place .  but director froehlich , judging from this movie , is an incompetent director , except for being able to film the seldom suspeneful scene .  well , come to think of it , there is only one scene that is actually scary , and it has to do with two actors being locked in a room as the killer tries to break in .  but other than that two-minute distraction , " return to horror high , " is certainly no great shake .  note : look for george clooney in a supporting role as one of the actors on the film .  and strangely enough , he is the first character to get the ax . . . literally . 
pos@ pos neg life is beautiful is a rare treat : a lighthearted comedy that tackles a very serious subject without committing the sins of being disrespectful , or , even worse , humorless .  it combines a charming romance with a dash of farce , stirs in a little poignancy , and ends up a very enjoyable movie .  it's an italian film , but don't let that discourage you .  subtitle-phobes will be missing a wonderful experience .  life is beautiful opens as a sweet romantic comedy , with the clownish , but good natured guido ( roberto benigni ) arriving in a rustic italian town to work as a waiter for his uncle .  the year is 1939 , and guido literally stumbles into the girl of his dreams , dora ( nicoletta braschi ) .  their romance seems to be picture perfect , with only one stumbling block : she's already engaged to another man .  can guido overcome the odds and win his girl ?  what do you think ?  however , five years later , things have taken a turn for the worse in italy .  the fascists have stepped up their race initiatives , which is bad news for the jewish guido and his new son giosue ( giorgio cantarini ) , who are rounded up and shipped off to a concentration camp .  unable to protect his boy in any other way , guido attempts to shield his young son from the horrors of the labor camp .  he pretends that everything is all an elaborate game , with points awarded for such tasks as hiding , being brave and being very very quiet .  as you can tell from the description , life is beautiful has two very different tones , but manages to excel at both of them .  as a romantic comedy , it is sweet and funny .  as a bittersweet tale of hope amid despair , it is touching .  roberto benigni's work here has been compared with some of the best of chaplin's , and it is easy to see why .  he is able to run the gamut of comic expression , from slapstick to farce , with a warm-hearted feeling that celebrates his downtrodden hero's " triumph of the underdog " spirit .  life is beautiful treads a thin line when it turns its attentions to the holocaust .  however , it is able to successfully navigate the minefield , without demeaning the gravity of the horrors involved , nor without losing its humorous edge that allows you to smile through the tears .  with life is beautiful , benigni has created a triumphant , but bittersweet comedy .  it's quite simply one of the most enjoyable times i've had at the movies this year . 
neg@ pos neg under any other circumstances , i would not be discussing the ending of a film to the extent that i will in this particular review .  however , in order to fully explain exactly how and why this movie is so awful , a minute dissection of the ending is necessary .  even though i will not reveal the details of the last scenes , do proceed at your own risk .  the movie opens ( quite poorly , i might add ) as child psychologist malcolm crowe ( bruce willis , looking like he was dragged out of his trailer at the wee hours of the morning to shoot each scene ) and his wife are intruded upon by one of malcolm's past patients .  distraught , the suicidal man ( a cameo by new kid on the block donnie wahlberg ) shoots malcolm and then turns the gun on himself .  cut to the " next fall " , as we find the good doctor quietly observing his latest case , a trouble young man named cole ( haley joel osment , one of the only child actors in a while i didn't want to bludgeoned over the head with a blunt instrument ) .  after about 45 minutes of seemingly unrelated freak occurrences , we learn that cole has " the sixth sense " , the gift of being able to communicate with the dead .  and this , as they say , is where the healing begins .  the sixth sense and its unexpected popularity is founded upon a twist ending that i knew going into the film ( one of roger ebert's colleges was kind enough to give it away on a recent segment of " siskel and ebert " ) .  although i was at first enraged that an established film critic could so callously ruin a film for thousands of patrons , i soon realized that this turn of events could in fact have been a blessing in disguise ; i've always been a sucker for surprise endings ( my favorite movie is the usual suspects ) and rarely dislike a film that sports one .  here , since i knew the major plot twist that was coming at the film's conclusion , the possibly of being bamboozled into loving a bad movie solely because of its ending ( something i've fallen victim to in the past ) was eliminated .  and indeed , my viewing of the sixth sense did prove to be quite an enlightening experiment .  stripped of the element of surprise , the film was put to the task of showing what it really had , instead of simply hiding behind a shocking conclusion .  after seeing its true colors , i came to the conclusion that the sixth sense is , despite what the many champions of the movie may say , void of any real power .  it's a neat concept , but not one that justifies being made into a feature-length movie .  in fact , the sixth sense relies so strongly on its finale that the rest of the film develops as a sort of prelude to the supposedly earth-shattering revelation that is yet to come .  and when the final moments do come , it's a huge letdown ; the end makes no sense at all .  it stupefied me with the heights of its ineptitude and is completely idiotic on a fundamental and very rare level .  i won't go into any details , but suffice to say that , as far as i can tell , it negates to rest of the movie to such an extent that anyone who buys it even for a second must be suffering from a very acute case of attention deficit disorder .  now , in all fairness , i cannot say for sure that i would have guessed the ending ( however stupid it may be ) had it not been revealed to me before hand .  however , i feel very confident that i , as well as anyone who had seen a few " twilight zone " episodes , would have seen it coming a mile away .  the fact that movie-goers nation wide are surprised by the ending still has me stumped .  ironically , to fully appreciate the best scene ( that of cole and malcolm attending a little girl's funeral ) , the viewer is required to be aware of a very rare psychological disorder called munchausen syndrome by proxy .  i wouldn't have even known about this mental disease if i hadn't , by pure dumb luck , caught " dateline nbc " the other week when they did a feature story on it .  despite being blessed with some really amazing cinematography and a brauva performance from osment ( where was this kid when casting calls were going out for the phantom menace ? ) , in the end , the sixth sense is too chalk-full of contradictions and just isn't plausible enough to warrant even a slight recommendation . 
pos@ pos neg lisa cholodenko's " high art , " is an intelligent , quiet drama .  its strongest quality , aside from the top-notch central performances , is the perceptive way in which the film , also written by cholodenko , observes its characters .  they are all flawed people , some more troubled than others , but they are not judged .  judging the characters in this picture would be a creative misstep on the filmmakers' parts , because no one , no matter how bad off they are , deserve to be negatively judged if they are involved in some serious problems that they cannot break free of .  syd ( radha mitchell ) , a 24-year-old woman living with her longtime boyfriend james ( gabriel mann ) , has recently been awarded an ideal job at the high-profile photography magazine , " frame . "  she very much enjoys where her career is headed , but is often not taken very seriously by her managers , who are always giving her petty jobs to do , when she knows she could be doing more important things .  one night , while taking a bath , syd notices a leak coming from the apartment above hers , so when she goes up there to inform them of it , she meets lucy beliner ( ally sheedy ) , a thin , worn-out , and unhappy woman , who lives with her drug-addicted german girlfriend , greta ( patricia clarkson ) , a pathetic former actress who is usually so out-of-it that she often is in and out of conciousness .  syd quickly strikes up a conversation with lucy , and discovers that she used to be an acclaimed photographer ten years before .  lucy claims she doesn't want to get back into the profession , but syd manages to convince the " frame " editors to do a piece on her work .  all the while , syd begins to grow deep feelings for lucy , even though she has never previously been attracted to a woman , and lucy starts a battle with her personal demons .   " high art , " is such an effective motion picture because it is never suger-coated or idealized , but instead an honest and convincing portrait of a handful of unhappy people whose lives are going nowhere , while syd's luck begins to rise .  the film in no way is about lesbianism , but about love , which was a refreshing change of pace from the usual stereotypical portraits of homosexuality .  as lucy and syd grow closer and closer together , we really do believe that they are falling in love with each other , even if the relationship might be doomed .  with this picture , ally sheedy's star has risen once again , thanks to her touching , nearly flawless portrtayal of lucy , a woman who , in the course of a decade , has found her life consumed almost entirely by drugs , which has taken away her once-blossoming career .  her characted really is tragic , and one particular scene involving lucy and her mother , in which lucy admits to her that she has a drug problem , and her mother matter-of-factly responds by saying she can't help her , is heartbreaking .  although not autobiographical , sheedy has had drug problems in her past , and i suspect she brought that knowledge of already being in lucy's footsteps to her role .  also very good is radha mitchell as syd , who previously starred in the slight 1997 australian comedy , " love and other catastrophes , " wh caught me by surprise with her performance .  easily being able to pass as christina ricci's older sister , mitchell obtains the same natural charisma that has made ricci so popular recently .  as accurate as almost every detail is in , " high art , " i wish the relationship had been more tightly written involving syd and james , who , played by gabriel mann , is left with a throwaway role .  by the time he finds out about syd and lucy , he disappears from the film , and i wish there had been another scene where they confronted each other .  this is a very minor fault , however , in a film that is full of riches .  although many of the characters are stuck in a hopeless pit of despair , syd and lucy are intelligent people who recognize their problems .  the character of dominique ( anh duong ) , the " frame " editor who decides to give syd a chance with her ideas , was also written to be far more mature than expected .  and the one sex scene in the film was beautifully and originally done .  for once , it did not invlove steaminess , or violent sexual activity , or gratuitous nudity , but focused on the actual characters , who love each other , and their insecurities involved in making the decision to actually have sex .   " high art , " which won the screenwriting award at the 1998 sundance film festival , marks the superior feature film debut of cholodenko , as well as sheedy's strongest , and best , role to date . 
neg@ pos neg warning : may contain slight mild spoilers .  rated : r for intense violence/gore , some strong sexuality and language .  starring : arnold schwarzeneggar , robin tunney , rod stieger , gabriel byrne .  running time : 132 minutes  we go into a movie theater , boom !  the lights go down , our hearts race , we go through ten minutes of preview and finally the movie we've been waiting to see for a long time comes on .  we sit there , watch in disbelief that this movie is as bad as it is .  why shouldn't i have know what i was getting myself into .  again like this past summers hit " stigmata " , " end of days " may be worse .  it's not like this is any kind of original idea , it just throws in some " rosemary's baby " , along with " the devil's advocate " a little " exorcist " and some " stigmata " here and there .  whala you have " end of days " a movie that is extremely disappointing and by the previews made it look terrific .  sadly but truly again like most recent films , all the good parts are in the trailers .  the plot which is very confusing at times is also very ludicrous and the movie is destined to be a hit in the first weekend , and flop in the next .  jericho cane ( arnold schwarzneggar in hit typical macho role ) is a cop who finds out that he is chosen to track down satan ( living in gabriel byrnes body ) and stop him from impregnating christine york ( robin tunney ) because if he does , and she gives birth all existence as we know it will cease to exist .  he has to do this before it turns into the year 2000 , and strangely he's trying to fight him 5 minutes before 2000 comes .  he seeks help from the catholic church and help from rod stieger ( in a terrific role ) and tries to save this girl leading to an ending that's satisfying , but turns into a typical action movie .  that's pretty much it on plot .  it does have the razzle and dazzle of a great action movie , and with the 100m dollar budget parts seem to show it , parts you have to wonder where all the money went .  as for arnie ?  good role , ok performance .  i think since he is getting a little older he is held back a lot of his stunts .  the thing that disappointed me was the fact that there was nothing to the film .  in the trailers it looks like a good scary , action film and ends up being a boring , long and preposterous drama that leads into something else that leaves us with questions .  gabriel byrnes ( who ironically played a priest in " stigmata " ) here plays satan and gives a good performance but again seems held back and not into his character .  two years back al pacino gave a terrific performance in the fun " the devil's advocate " and here it seems like the idea of him is in the character also .  robin tunney ( great performance as always ) plays satan's main person whom he wants to impregnate to carry his child .  of course rod stieger gives another great performance which really isn't nothing new .  the direction by peter hyams is at times a bit overblown , though not nearly as the visual style was in " stigmata " .  here we are given great camera work , and some great scenes that are terrifically directed but sadly just don't work in this movie .  the script written by andrew marlowe has a few witty lines , but again the movie is all style and no substance and by the ending finale climax i was ready to go home .  only a few things work here and those are a few of the performances , the writing and visual style , but the storyline and the finished product don't work as well .  the sad thing is that " end of days " had so many things going for it .  the plot could have been more organized , the action scenes could have been more brainy and less mind-numbing .  at times it seems like " armageddon " and started to get old and tiresome .  hollywood is running out of ideas bad , and like i've always said before needs new ones .  even with its 100m budget " end of days " is less than pleasing .  in fact the 100m dollar budget is at least 30m over , and easily could have had a 70m budget .  maybe i sound crazy , but i am really looking forward to the new exorcist film , and hope that they make it as good as the original .  we need to get new ideas and stop recycling old ones just to make money at the box-office .  we need to get more films like " the blair witch project " that could scare people to death , while people thinking well what exactly is scaring them and how do i know that it is in fact the blair witch .  overblown effects , stupid and thin plot-line , good performances , disappointing . . . . umm  yup those pretty much describe " end of days " . 
pos@ pos neg  " a bug's life " may not be " toy story , " but it's more close than " antz " was .  i really liked " antz , " basically because , yes , it is clever and witty and intelligent ( and it has the temerity to take a chance and put woody allen in the lead , perhaps the year's most inspired casting ) , but there was , in fact , something missing from it , and i'm the first to admit that .  maybe it's that it never totally lets go and takes off into real innocent fun - it's too obsessed with its orwellian message to become totally engaging , and if it weren't for woody allen , it would have been just a really clever good-not-great flick .   " a bug's life " has a similar premise , and it also has disney to insure that it's g-rated and not totally over kids' heads like " antz " was ( not a bad thing , believe me ) , but what it also has is a tone that's completely innocent even when it's also remaining perpetually clever .   " antz " is still the more witty film , and i love it for it , and " a bug's life " is more for general consumption , but it's also more entertaining .  it broadens its horizons , and when it really moves from the ant colony , it really shows us a whole new world we've never seen before , and it's take on the evolution of bugs is a lot better than the one in " antz . "  it's also light and clever .  the visuals are , instead of earth tones , bright worldly colors , and still gives the amazing visual technology of " antz " at least a worthy contender .  the characters are also nicely realized - though watered-down for broad consumption , they still carry more wit than the contemporary disney animated films .  the lead character , flik ( voiced by dave foley ) , is nothing more than a slightly-less neurotic z from " antz , " but foley makes him nearly as engaging as allen made z . instead of gene hackman playing the villain , we get the much more menacing kevin spacey as the lead grasshopper , the nicely-titled hopper .  and for the romantic lead , we don't get spacey sharon stone , but intelligent and hard-to-get julia-louis dreyfuss , who doesn't even come around until the very final frames .  not that the plot's really any better than the one in " antz " - it's basically yet another redux of " the seven samurai , " with an ant colony under the control of giant grasshoppers forcing them to produce a product for them or else .  when flik , a bone fide inventor , creates a time-conserving apparatus that accidentally destroys the season's donation , he puts them all in risk , and is sent away so that he won't screw anything up with the pretense that he is searching for help to fight the grasshoppers .  he runs into a group of " warrirors " who are , unbeknownst to him , a group of carnival bugs , and they agree to help under similar false pretenses .  these bugs are an equally wonderful assortment to anything in " toy story " : foppish walking stick slim ( david hyde-pierce ) , german caterpillar heimlich ( joe ranft ) , quick-tempered and insecure male ladybug francis ( denis leary ) , pretentious praying mantis manny ( jonathan harris ) , his assistant butterfly hypsy ( madeliene kahn ) , spider rosie ( bonnie hunt ) , and two fleas , tuck and roll ( michael mcshane ) , who speak in undiscernable jibberish .  the writers lightly touch on each bug's place in bug society and the malleability thereof while making a wisecracks at everything they can , and blowing the audience away with wild visual treats .  grasshoppers jumping in unison seems like a menacing earthquake .  a small bird becomes an ominous mortal threat , whose usual mild-mannered squeal is a scream of death .  the bug city is a modern-day metropolis , complete with fireflies temping as traffic lights and a fly sitting on the curb , holding out a cup , with a sign lying next to him that says " kid tore off wings . "  and a rainstorm is like a giant flood , with each drop acting like a small bomb dropped at millions of miles per hour .  around this , the pixar animators stage several large set pieces , like a resuce mission halfway through that is as wild and entertaining as anything this year , and a wonderfully exciting action piece at the end , a chase scene at night through the labyrinthine branches of a small thicket .  meanwhile , each character gets the spotlight to be completely idisyncratic and interesting , something " antz " couldn't do , and by the end , over the end credits , " a bug's life " pulls it's final punch , out clever-ing " antz " with a series of incessantly hilarious faux-bloopers that come just at the right time , when those who leave immeadiately after the final frame of a film have left , and you can brag that you were one of the elite who stayed and got the full money's worth of entertainment .  still , it's no " toy story . "  that film , maybe above any animated film i've ever seen , encompassed almost true perfection in story , character , and wit .  it proved that it didn't need to brag about it's cutting edge technology to really soar ( it's the least visually striking of the three computer animated films thus far , but is still the most satisfying ) , and created a perfect world of idiosyncratic delights and innocent fun .  yet " a bug's life , " as well as " antz , " are still amazing films , and prove without doubt , that if you're gonna make a computer animated film , send it to the guys who created these three flicks , evne if they're not working under the same roof . 
neg@ pos neg it seems that i've stopped enjoying movies that should be fun to watch .  take payback , for example , a movie that most people seem to like .  however , it's horrible schlock , straight out of hollywood's vast talent for sucking creativity out of movies .  it was written and directed by a guy who should have done better ; however , maybe he did do better , after all , 30 percent of the movie isn't his own .  mel gibson , that hollywood zombie , decided he didn't like the ending and had another director reshoot it .  what a crock .  if you sign on to do a movie , then do it the way the script calls for .  why film a movie and then look at it later and say , - no , i changed my mind , i don't like the ending .  you're fired .  let's get someone else to do it .  - i suppose honor is dead in hollywood .  the end of the film is , of course , hollywoodized .  which is to say that it's happy and the guy you root for beats impossible odds to win his prize .  in this case , as is most victories in hollywood movies , gibson's prize is a blond and money .  i miss originality in film , i really do .  i think audiences are so starved for it that they'll flop down a lot of money in hopes that a movie will be original .  payback's tagline - get ready to root for the bad guy - promised an original idea , but it was far from the truth .  while gibson's character certainly broke the law , he was a character that had honor ( odd that gibson himself seems to have very little of it ) , wouldn't kill in front of children and protects his blond woman .  there's nothing bad about him - he's a hollywood character , a person who could never exist in real life .  and gibson knows it - he spends his time trying to act like a " bad guy " , and instead comes off as pretentious and arrogant .  the story involves gibson being double-crossed by his partner ( who is a real bad guy , which made me wish that we could root for him ) over $70 , 000 .  gibson recovers from multiple gunshots , is pissed ( naturally ) , and will do whatever it takes to get the exact amount of money back - no more , no less .  he makes a point of it that it's strictly 70 grand .  a real bad guy would have made his ex-partner pay 25% interest .  this idea is completely stretched out .  gibson ends up going after his partner and the chicago mafia that his partner is affiliated with .  what i didn't understand - this is the chicago mafia .  $70 , 000 is like spare change to them .  they'd probably just pay the guy rather than go through the trouble of dealing with him .  i think they'd respect a guy going through this much trouble for a simple $70 , 000 .  maybe i'm being too hard on the movie .  perhaps the filmmakers were just trying to make a simple popcorn movie .  i read roger ebert's review and he liked gibson in the role because he is a comic at heart playing a bad guy .  that's why we're allowed to root for him .  and it's true - gibson walks the movie as if he's smiling at a joke he just heard .  but he's wrong here .  i wanted a lee marvin or old-time clint eastwood or somebody who wasn't a comic , just an ass kicker .  as a side note , i've just checked the internet movie database and discovered that i am the 38th person to post a newsgroup review of payback .  after this many reviews , why would anyone want to read this ?  really , i don't care .  i'm just trying to gain membership into the on-line film critics society by posting as many reviews as i can . 
pos@ pos neg one can not observe a star trek movie and expect to see serious science fiction .  the purpose of star trek is to provide flashy , innocent fun .  sometimes the stories are compelling .  sometimes they're not .  but , with the exception of the first film in the series ( which provides little more than endless shots of amazed faces ) , i've never been bored by any of the enterprise's numerous missions .  star trek : insurrection is no exception .  the film has gotten some negative reviews ( a friend of mine actually thinks it's the worst in the series ) , but i'm not really sure why .  it's an exciting , often hilarious movie that engaged me and left me ready for the next star trek film .  some say it's a bit too light , and more of a long episode than a film .  others say the special effects are cheesy and that it's boring .  i simply enjoyed the film .  insurrection , which is the second film to feature strictly the next generation cast , introduces us to a race of people called the ba'ku ; the ba'ku are very old ( most of them are about three hundred years old ) , but they actually appear younger with age due to strange radiation in the rings of their planet .  of course , these peaceful people can't horde this fountain of youth all for themselves ? leave it up to their archenemies , the son'a , led by ru'afo ( f .  murray abraham ) , to mess everything up .  the son'a , who are horribly disfigured and rely on daily reconstructive surgery to be aesthetically acceptable , strike a deal with the federation to move the ba'ku elsewhere and exploit the secret to keep their race from dying .  that's when captain picard ( patrick stewart ) steps in : he realizes that moving the ba'ku would kill them ( it also helps that he falls in love with a ba'ku woman ( donna murphy ) ) .  so , with his trusty crew , picard defies the federation to keep the ba'ku in their natural habitat .  when dealing with a series with as much history as this , it's not entirely necessary to re-introduce your characters with each episode .  this is why i believe non-fans have a hard time getting into star trek ; in order to enjoy it , one has to understand how to approach it .  insurrection , however , does a surprisingly good job of us new aspects of the characters .  stewart is bold as always , a magnetic screen presence and perfectly capable of holding an entire film together .  jonathan frakes , who also directed , is funny as commander riker ; a subplot with data ( brent spiner ) discovering his lost childhood is fairly interesting ; and abraham makes a perfect star trek villain , overacting like crazy .  frakes showed similar aptitude for direction in first contact ; insurrection is an exciting film , with some really attractive special effects and a lot of good action .  this is apparently the first star trek film to utilize computer animation , and the result is very pleasing to the eye : particularly in the climactic scenes , in which the son'a employ a giant space ship to suck up the rings of the ba'ku planet , the special effects have a clean , impressively sharp look .  if i have any complaint about the film , it's that it tries to take a moral stance when it's not very appropriate to do so .  i don't think it's that big of a deal that the federation wanted to move 600 ba'ku in order to save the lives of thousands .  better yet , why couldn't they have co-existed ?  insurrection feels a little to light to spring these kinds of big moral questions on the audience .  with it's inherent camp factor , the star trek series doesn't seem well-equipped to deal with issues like this .  i prefer to just enjoy the spectacle . 
neg@ pos neg i had an epiphany today .  it occurred to me while i was watching " house on haunted hill . "  it is as follows : if a trailer makes the film it's advertising look like a trashy , stupid movie , well guess what ?  chances are , there * is * truth in advertising .  too bad i didn't trust my own instincts when something-or-the-other possessed me to see this movie .  i blame it on my sudden craving for a scare and my anticipation of " sleepy hollow . "  that and " dogma " started too late in the afternoon for my schedule .  an hour of " angel " or " buffy " is scarier than this doozy that tries to be scary and shtick but falls flat on its face .  i wish i'd seen it when it was halloween .  at least i would have been forgiving .  hey , tis the season .  the movie was scary ( albeit very confusing , dizzying , and nauseating ) at first , but soon the horror got repetitive and downright laughable because the film obviously wasn't going anywhere .  now i truly appreciate films like " scream , " " halloween , " or any old hitchcock film where the scariness stems from situations that are at least somewhat realistic .  that's what spooks people out , the fact that it could happen to them or someone they know .  there has to be a logical precedent for the situations they want to scare us with .  sure , utterly unpredictable is good , too , but that's different from utterly nonsensical .  hohh ( house on haunted hill ) , on the other hand .   .   .  well let's just say i about fell off my chair laughing when they oh-so-cleverly revealed that everyone who got invited to the party was related to the psycho doctors who died in the house a couple of decades ago .  riiiiight .  y'know , that just sends chills down my spine .  yeah .  just like i wet my pants when they told me the house is evil .  ooooooo .  hint : blood and guts only work a few times .  sooner or later people start to tell themselves that it's just ketchup and props and you've got to come up with something better than that .  there were just too many things in this movie that we've all seen before ; from the inevitable " plot developments " of strangers unwittingly trapped together ; strangers turning against each other ; the evil manifesting itself ; the dead coming back for a last scare .  each was more predictable than the last .  why didn't these fools just stay together in one place anyways ?  sheesh .  was i grossed out ?  yes .  did i get spooked a few times ?  yes .  but why ?  i get really disturbed when there is no why .  when there weren't random scares that were there for no other reason than for the visual effect ( which wasn't that good either , trust me ) and the scare , the film was filled with drab , laughable dialogue .  the characters were incredibly flat and cliched .  not to mention downright annoying .  you've got a bunch of people going nowhere in their lives ; of course they're dumb enough to go to a party some stranger invited them to provided they win a million dollars if they survive the night .  jeez , i thought no one fell for those " you may already be a winner " things anymore .  and of course , all three gals are babes .  i wonder how on earth the geoffrey rush of " shine " ended up in this movie .  keep that up , geoff , and you'll qualify for the next batman venture .  the only single person i enjoyed was chris kattan because , well , he just cracks me up .  and famke jansen ( sp ? )  because she reminds me of the delectable brosnan .  pierce brosnan ( hey , i willingly endured " dante's peak " three times for him : ) .  all right , i concede .  there were a couple of things i enjoyed .  that perverted little amusement park at the beginning .  i probably won't ride a rollercoaster for a while .  and the machine they used to drive geoffrey's character mad ( see , i don't even remember their names ) .  the machine , not that stupid fishtank with naked wimmin in it .  i kept waiting and waiting for that inevitable twist at the end of the movie .  it wouldn't have redeemed the film , but at least it would have made me feel better .  but no , they opted for the beautiful sunrise ending .  thank god they didn't add a kiss at the end or i would have puked .  god , there is no hope . 
pos@ pos neg you've heard all the hype .  you've seen all their faces - natalie portman ( the professional ) as queen amidala , liam neeson ( schindler's list ) as qui-gon jinn , ewan mcgregor ( trainspotting ) as obi-wan kenobi , and jake lloyd ( jingle all the way ) as young anakin skywalker .  if you've read any reviews , you've also probably heard that this movie fails to live up to the magic and humanity of the first trilogy .  you also may have heard that this one's too kiddie-friendly , and doesn't have enough content for adults .  believe the hype .  the effects are stunning , the digitalized creatures are amazingly realistic , the lightsaber duels are amazing , and queen amidala's sumptuous robes are fit to be worn by queen elizabeth .  but there's something missing here , and it isn't budget or effects - it's everything money * can't * buy .  the actors struggle as best they can to flesh out broad-stroked and flat characters .  the most successful at this is liam neeson who , as qui-gon jinn , a jedi master to young obi-wan kenobi , has quiet dignity and a wise , commanding presence .  he is the anchor to this movie , as he is the one character who george lucas apparently spent some time fleshing out .  portman's queen amidala and mcgregor's obi-wan kenobi don't fare nearly so well .  amidala , the future mother of luke and leia and the queen of a peaceful planet being invaded by the trade federation ( ? ! ? ) , comes off as stoic , stilted and caricatured ( it appears as though she was a vulcan geisha in a former life ) .  and obi-wan , although mcgregor makes him very endearing , has so little screen time that he's nothing but a robin to qui-gon jinn's batman .  however , mcgregor does struggle manfully to infuse this surprisingly small supporting role with a spark of genuine insight and humanity , and he does a good job .  he also absolutely nails alec guiness' ( obi-wan in episode 4 - 6 ) scottish accent , and that really makes his presence in the film more profound than it might have been otherwise .  in fact , lucas seems to bank on that preexisting knowledge quite a bit , and that's one of the problems with this film .  i would never call myself a " star wars " fan - especially not considering what it means to be a fanatic these days - but i've always enjoyed the films along with everyone else in america .  however , if you are the one person in america who * hasn't * seen the films at all or even recently , or who doesn't bother to brush-up on the names of obscure characters , you may be hopelessly lost .  for example , one of the film's main ( nefarious ) characters is senator palpatine .  for those of you not recently steeped in " star wars " trivia , emperor palpatine is that scary hooded apparition who was darth vader's master in " return of the jedi " and " empire strikes back . "  so , obviously , his appearance in " phantom menace " is meant to stir some echoes of his later role in the series , thus making his role here more meaningful .  a lot of the movie is like that .  r2-d2 and c-3po make token appearances , and it's obvious that lucas is banking on the audience's pre-existing fondness for them . . .  because he doesn't do much to add to it in any way .  same goes for jabba the hutt , who doesn't look as much mean here as he does corpulent and lazy .  even * planets * make foreshadowing guest appearances in this film - tatooine ( the desert world where luke grew up ) , coruscant ( the cloud city from " empire strikes back " ) , and alderaan ( leia's home planet - which we never actually see - that gets blown up in " star wars " ) show up or are mentioned briefly in passing .  what's the result of tying so many plot points and characters to future films ?  the answer is that this one seems surprisingly empty .  there's no meat - no substance - that makes you want to love the characters as they are , not as they will be .  another problem is that there are actually * too many * alien characters in the film .  i was distracted by the fact that two of the main evil characters - strange looking aliens who looked like gila monsters - had mouths that barely moved , making them look more like muppets than actual characters .  and jar jar binks , a silly roger rabbitish amphibious character , is intended as comic relief , but what he really becomes is annoying - and fast .  unlike chewbacca and c-3po , who got their humanity ( if you'll pardon the expression ) from their interactions with the human characters , jar jar is often left to interact mostly with others of his kind , at times making the movie seem like nothing more than a very expensive " teenage mutant ninja turtles . "  furthermore , the dialogue is often stilted and corny , and sometimes downright infantile , thereby rendering some characters into nothing more than bystanders to the plot .  oddly , this isn't just * my * judgment - lucas has said that he designed this film for kids .  well , he's done a good job .  the hero of this film , of course , is young anakin , but it was very hard for me to feel any kinship or identify with an eight-year-old boy .  that's not jake lloyd's fault , though - he does a good job of being a cute kid , which is apparently all lucas asked of him .  that's another mistake , of course , because the cute tyke becomes darth vader .  warning : spoilers ahead ! ! ! !  in my opinion , there was not nearly enough foreshadowing of anakin's future evil in the film .  the boy is all blond flowing hair and rosy cheeks , and there's nothing more than a spark of aggression in him throughout the entire movie .  he has a doting mother ( pernilla august , making her first english- language film ) and is a slave to a gross flying gnome on tatooine .  but the only indication the audience gets that this kid isn't all hearts and roses is yoda's hesitation in allowing him to train as a jedi under qui-gon jinn .  his explanation ?   " his future is clouded . "   ( warning : major spoiler ahead .  enter at your own risk . )  of course , the noble qui-gon dies at the hand of darth maul , a scary-looking sith lord who excels at the jedi arts , but has turned to the dark side .  this dude has maybe two lines in the entire movie , but he establishes his presence through his amazing moves with his double-sided lightsaber , and his scary facial makeup .  because qui-gon never gets a chance to train the young anakin in the ways of the force , obi-wan , qui-gon's young padawan apprentice ( one level below knightdom ) , must take over the training himself .  so , at the end of the movie , we end where the saga actually begins - with obi-wan kenobi and his young apprentice , anakin " darth vader " skywalker .  did this story need to be told ?  i would say no .  but is it a worthwhile movie to see ?  absolutely .  if you don't enter the theater with jedi-size expectations , and you simply want to be treated to an enjoyable visual spectacle , then this is your movie .  the tatooine pod races are a triumph of effects and computer animation .  the digitalized backgrounds on some of the planets are an astonishing sight .  and yoda and young obi-wan are worth seeing for their origins in a simpler , happier time .  above all , this is a fun movie .  not deep , not meaningful , and not profound .  but fun .  maybe next time , lucas will hire lawrence kasdan to co-write the script , and the guy who directed " empire " will direct .  because if lucas does the next one himself , it will be lacking the one thing it needs the most - potential .   : ) 
neg@ pos neg to put it bluntly , ed wood would have been proud of this .  a totally ridiculous plot is encompassed with bad humor , hokey drama , zero logic and a crap screenplay .  also , a beautifully anti-climactic ending .  not to say it didn't look intriguing when i saw the previews .  so much for truth in advertising .  roland emmerich , who's later " independence day " would look like " the 400 blows " compared to this , co-writed and directed this inane sci-fi film which uses the cliche of there being some connection between eqypt and aliens .  in a useless opening sequence , men find a stone in 1914 with hieroglyphics on it .  it wouldn't be till present day ( '94 ) till they would actually figure it out .  they're decipherer ?  a slightly-neurotic scientist ( nice twist ) , dr . dan jackson ( james spader , doing his best outside of erotic thrillers and some indy fare ) who's life sucks so much that people walk out of his lectures after the third word .  why do they use him to decipher what no one else could ?  so there is a hokey ending !  duh !  he figures it out in about a minute .  yea .  and then they get a suicidal colonel or something , " jack " o'neill ( kurt russel , with his wyat earp locks in the beginning then a flat-top that would make howie long snap into a fetal position ) .  why a suicidal colonel ?  for the ending !  you'll get the hang of this .  they open the stargate , a bunch of them go through it with a bomb to blow it up if they find anything bad .  after an overdone special effects thing , they're . . . inside a goddam pyramid .  so they went to egypt , right ?  wrong .  they're on another planet that was filmed in egypt .  they discover a cilvilization ruled by ra , the sun god ( the androginous jaye davidson , with a voice modifier to make him sound like barry white with asthma ) , and there are fights , explosions and a kiss between two people .  yea .  also melodrama , stupidity , hokey scenes and a bizarre language .  an anti-climactic ending ends with stupid lines ( " say hello to king tut , asswhole ! "  - the quintessential line , lemme tell ya ) and some convenient pesudo-pseudo-pseudo-character development .  by the end , you just wanna go home and watch , i don't know , the " outer limits " or something .  the script's terrible .  the special effects are okay , but nothing great .  the story's so weak that it's almost opaque .  the whole experience just isn't worth it unless you're so bored that you'd consider watching a " full house " marathon . . . or  this .  i'd pick this , obviously , but still , it's just not fun at all .  and i can't wait for it to premier on mst3k . 
pos@ pos neg go's is a gloriously slick hip machine .  director liman ( who also photographed go ) and screenwriter august celebrate the drug/rave scene in l . a . , preferring to take ( comedic ) snapshots of troubled youth rather than critique them .  after more than ninety minutes of pill-popping , tantric sex , car chases , and attempted murder , go even has a happy ending .  this is the sort of film that gives members of the dove foundation splitting headaches ; as go wound down , i anticipated an anti-pill-popping-casual-tantric-sex-car-chase-attempted-murder sermon that ( blessedly ) didn't arrive .  a la tarantino's pulp fiction , go is comprised of three separate but related stories .  the basics are as follows : ronna ( polley ) is a bitter grocery store clerk facing eviction who turns to drug dealing for extra dough .  her co-worker , simon ( the improbably named askew ) , is a clubber from britain ecstatic about his first trip to vegas .  zack ( mohr ) and adam ( wolf ) are soap opera stars escaping a career-threatening conviction by assisting a peculiar cop ( fichtner ) in a drug bust .  perhaps because the innovative structure of tarantino's non-linear masterwork is by now old hat , the id-fueled go delighted me but rarely surprised me ( with the exception of that mind-reading cat ! ) ;  pulp fiction zigzagged down roads unforeseen , but we see go's wheels turning from its first flash frame to the last .  torontonian polley ( of the sweet hereafter ) refused to do publicity for this picture on the basis that she was " not pleased with " her turn as the ill-fated cashier .  in go , she delivers , hands-down , her best performance to date .  here's an ( overrated ) actress who agreed to appear on the poster , but not support her team at the junket or in interviews ; this sort of arrogance is commonplace for ms . polley , as anyone who has read of her political agenda in the canadian press will tell you .  if she doesn't want to be the ingenue of the moment , she should have said " no , " not go .  but i digress .  go is a fun film , so chipperly depraved one can't help but turn off his moral judgment for its duration and enjoy the ride .  in that sense , it's a departure from liman's last film , swingers , which at least lectured against self-absorption in the form of vince vaughan's trent and his subtle comeuppance in the story's clever epilogue ( which has been aped by mcdonald's for their latest commercial ) .  i wish i cared more about go's characters : like the techno music they listen to , the bands of anarchists on display here are at once absorbing and vacuous .  when the lights came up and stung my eyes , it was difficult to recall what about it entertained me .  yet entertain me it did .  go is light and frothy , featuring compelling if not endearing work by polley , timothy olyphant ( scream 2 ) , and especially fichtner , whose homoerotic behavior is milked for effective laughs .  fichtner is a character actor best known for playing backstabbers ( in heat , armageddon , and others ) ; his previously untapped comic abilities shine in go .  unlike much of the film , fichtner is unpredictable . 
neg@ pos neg around the end of 1998 , a japanese cartoon came to the usa television , and really wasn't that big .  in fact not many people even knew what pokemon was , but in 1999 it hit big with kids and adults alike , and became one of the biggest franchises and merchandise seller of all time .  in fact it even spawned a big screen adventure pokemon : the first movie which for what it was , wasn't all that bad .  it grossed $31 million in its opening weekend , and went on to make almost $90 million .  fans thought it was great and now is a second movie in the pokemon craze , " pokemon : the movie 2000 " which is far inferior to the original animated movie .  first up is the plot , which there really isn't much of , in fact the plot what there is : a bad guy trying to destroy the ancient never before seen pokemon , lugia , is about it , except the fact that ash kethcum the worlds best pokemon trainer must try and stop him before he destroys this one pokemon forever .  well there you go , of course ash is followed by his friends misty , brock , gary and his pokemon friends , pikachu , squirtle , charizard , the usual .  even though the first movie wasn't a great film , it was definately an enjoyable well-made movie with an actual thin storyline .  this new movie however is nothing but garbage , there is nothing good to it storywise , and its only good thing comes from some plush animation and colors .  compared to the first film , this movie is awfully bland , from its opening titles , to the end titles it tries its best to work , but fails miserably at every corner .  the characters are 1-dimensional , the story thin as chicken broth , and the writing very lame .  even the so called action scenes are extremely lame , and falls before it even gets a chance to go .  the voices even aren't that good and almost feels like the stars don't want to be there , like they can tell that this is an extremel bad movie .  which it certainly is .  the film has one thing going for it and that is the animation , although not up to disney standards , it is still very good with some interesting cgi's and very colorful animation , the colors jump out at you very fast , and seem very nicely put on film .  why a film this bad got such a good treatment with its animation is still a question to be answered , hopefully pokemon 3 next year will be much better than this trash .  for now watch the first one .  its much much better . 
pos@ pos neg  " the celebration " is one of an elite kind of films that is completely absorbant .  you know , where you sit down to watch it , and no matter what you've heard about it before , you just can't help but be totally drawn into its story and shocked by every single turn that occurs .  i prefer films like these because these are what the best kind of films are like .  i don't really feel there are to be any real " rules " for cinema ; a film can do anything , as long as it makes it work .  but i do ask that all films have one thing in common : they create experiences .  when i watch a film , no matter what kind of film it is , i want to be able to take certain memories along with me .   " the celebration " is great because it's chock full of those .  it creates a world so completely realistic that everything that occurs is as memorable as the little instances of life that catch your attention and stay with you for the rest of your life .  and then it makes things just a tad bit farscial , just to make sure you're paying attention , which you are because what transpires is just so goddam interesting that if you were to ever feel bored , then you're of your attention span needs a bit of a tuning-up .  the story takes place at the extravagant home of an aging patriarch ( henning mortizen ) , who has just turned 60 and is having a party thrown for him .  all his friends and family turn up , and for the first half hour , we get introduced to everyone , simplistically and realistically ( no aggravatingly condescending posing for the camera deals here ) .  the eldest son , christian ( ulrich thomsen , looking a bit like a young malcolm mcdowell ) , is the first to be seen in the film , walking to his father's home .  his brother , michael ( thomas bo larsen ) , drives by , pulls over , greets him , then kicks his family out of the car , forcing them to walk to the estate , just so christian can be comfortable .  we then meet helene ( paprika steen ) , their sister , a woman who always seems to be stressed-out , who invites the driver of her car ( gbatokai dakinah ) , an american , to to come join her at the party she's going to .  once they're all there and settled in , the party begins , and as custom , the eldest son has to make a speech to his dad , so christian stands up , at the head of the table , and reveals the film's punchline : his father raped all his children at a young age .  but since this is a family/friends affair , his confession becomes more detested than the supposed truth , and is simply brushed off despite his efforts , and what transpires is sorta like jerry springer crossed with jean renoir , and it's all terribly interesting to watch .  twists occur , and soon the film has taken on a nearly-farsical nature , but still seems realistic because the people involved really feel like they could reach such ends .  the most notorious thing about this film , which has been getting the most notice , though , is that the director , thomas vinterberg has shot it in a completely awkward fashion .  as a member of the danish filmmakers clan , dogme 95 , a group that has vowed to oppose " the auteur concept , make-up , illusions , and dramaturgical predictability " so that they may " purge film so that once again the inner lives of the characters justify the plot . "  i have not seen " breaking the waves , " the other notable film by a member of this group ( lars von trier , to be exact ) , but " the celebration " works exquisitely in this department .  it feels like reality , like you're actually watching real people and not actors , and as a major pointer , has been shot on video .  as a result , it looks more like the home movies you never dare shot of your family than an actual film , but always wanted to .  we see key moments in people's lives that they wouldn't dare show to the world , and it captures the farscial comedy of life so accurately and acutely that this style , as ironically-showmanship as it really is , works perfectly for the nature of the film .  the key , though , to this film , and the reason it's not just a cool danish import , is because this film is not about revealing the truth as much as it is about the way people react to such an explosive truth .  throughout the film , we see a completely realized debate over the truth and the effects it has on the lives of those who have learned to live with lies , a debate so three-dimensional that it could easily blow oliver stone and his the-truth-at-all-costs reasoning out of the water .  of course it was not right for the father to rape his children , and of course , they couldn't have fought back then , and of course this has created scarring suppression inside them .  and yes , it's thearapeutic for one to release the truth years later , when they know it could easily destroy the one who emotionally destroyed them earlier .  but then again , the father , after all , is not a totally bad guy , and we can see the emotional complications that arise thanks to a performance by mortizen which is just so great and touching that while we do believe that he could have raped his children years earlier , we also see a man who has also learned to live with what he's done , and deep down , feels true guilt that is only now beginning to surface .  the final scene , involving mortizen and everyone else , is utterly devastating , thanks to him and thomsen , whose performance is utterly flawless and equally emotionally complex .  everyone else is flawless as well - the actors never seem to be stepping into the shoes of their characters as much as they do walking comfortably in them .  the actors or writers have not made the mistake to judge these characters in the slightest : there are no whites or blacks but instead all grays , exactly like life .  as such , " the celebration " may be the one truly bizarro film of the year : a work of art so eerily close to reality that it's utterly disturbing and utterly fascinating . 
neg@ pos neg i didn't come into city of angels expecting greatness .  i've never seen wim wenders' wings of desire , the classic movie upon which city is loosely based .  then again , i have seen enough stories which are based upon a similar plot device , with the little mermaid ( both the disney version and the original folktale ) being among them , that i had some high expectations about the possible power such a story of impossible love can hold .  unfortunately , city of angels ended up fulfilling few of them .  the plot , for those that couldn't tell from the previews , revolves around the angel seth , played with an almost creepy intensity by nicolas cage , who , in the midst of his angelic duties , falls in love with a heart surgeon named maggie ( meg ryan in her most endearing performance since when harry met sally ) .  of course , his being an angel prevents him from doing much about his love except appearing at random times to talk to her , watch her buy groceries , only to disappear in the blink of an eye .  their love must remain unrequited unless seth decides to make the ultimate sacrifice and become human .  using this framework as a jumping-off point , the movie attempts to veer through some heavy philosophical ruminations on the nature of desire , the joys of being human , and the definition of perfection .  the first half of the movie succeeds on most points .  cage excellently plays the eminently difficult role of an angel who doesn't know feelings so can't really express , preventing the character of seth from getting boring despite his limited repertoire of intent looks and hang-dog expressions .  unfortunately , cage takes the intensity too far sometimes , and then seth comes across as more creepy than sensitive .  as maggie , ryan manages to be convincing as a heart surgeon who has trouble coming to terms with her having lost a patient on the operating table despite having done everything right .  her beauty , unlike her unbearable cuteness in french kiss , is mature , intelligent , and winning .  likewise , some interesting ideas float around at the beginning of the film .  when the camera pans through traffic jams and libraries and we get to hear the thoughts of the random people who flash across the screen , the audience experiences a little of what it must be like to be an angel .  the beautiful camera work , shooting down onto the hectic world of los angeles from the improbable perches of the angels , also gives us a sense of the unique wonder angels feel .  the film begins to lose its way , though , when the focus tightens more and more on seth and maggie .  the grand , angelic perspective gets lost , except for some idly tossed lines about the incredible beauty of the world through an angel's eyes .  the movie devolves into an examination of how seth can't feel the world or , more importantly , he can't feel maggie : he can't smell her hair , feel her touch , or taste the pears she eats .  this change in focus attempts to capture the audience in seth's intense longing , but in doing so , the conflict disappears .  if he wants maggie so badly , then why doesn't her just make the leap and become human ?  after all , what's so great about being an angel ?  sure , you get to sit on marlboro signs , but what's that compared to getting to be with meg ryan ?  and from there , once the yearning has been established and the romantic denouement must occur , it's all downhill .  the philosophy becomes heavy-handed , the dialogue pedestrian when it tries to be deep , and the plot twists simply attempt to yank a few more tears into the audience's hankie .  it's the last thirty minutes of the movie , then , that wrecks the film .  i feel like the writer , by pulling out all the melodramatic stops , has robbed me of what could have been a genuinely powerful movie experience on both the romantic and the philosophical level .  i came out feeling robbed , seeing so much possibility in a film becoming nothing .  i could go on longer , but i don't want to " ruin " the end by revealing any of the cheap plot devices the film relies on .  city of angels , then , is a paradox .  it's a well-acted ( particularly look for dennis franz cutting against type-casting as a happy-go-lucky fallen angel ) , well-filmed , and based on a wonderful idea .  all these possibilities , though , are what make the film so unredeemable when the closing credits come up . 
pos@ pos neg ralph fiennes is carving out a nice niche for himself in the genre of period piece romances .  for his followup to the academy-beloved the english patient , he has once again turned to a love story , this time directed by accomplished australian film maker gillian armstrong ( little women ) .  despite some obvious overplotting , oscar and lucinda is a mostly effective and often affecting motion picture that touches our hearts while daring our minds to balk at its implausible coincidences .  the film opens in the mid-1800s , with parallel storylines in new south wales , australia and devon , england .  as the helpful narrative voice of geoffrey rush informs us , lucinda leplastrier ( cate blanchett ) is a headstrong young woman being raised in the australian outback .  meanwhile , half the world away , oscar hopkins ( fiennes ) has broken with his puritanical father over religious issues , and has gone away to school to study to be an anglican priest .  lucinda is fascinated with glass ; oscar is obsessed with theology .  lucinda is rich ; oscar is poor .  lucinda is forward and self-assured ; oscar is timid and uncertain of himself .  yet one characteristic unites these two diverse individuals -- the compulsion to gamble , whether it's on horses , dogs , cards , or the flip of a coin .  and fate has decreed that they will one day meet .  that day doesn't occur until 45 minutes into the film , when oscar boards a ship bound for sidney , australia , where he hopes to change his life and minister to anyone in need of his help .  another of the passengers is lucinda , who is returning from england where she was shopping for machinery to equip her newly-acquired glassworks factory .  at first , their relationship is that of a reverend and a confessor , but it doesn't take long for both of them to recognize a kindred spirit in the other .  a friendship is born , and , once they reach australia , it develops into something more potent .  but oscar is uncertain of lucinda's affection , and feels he must do something to prove himself worthy of her .  oscar and lucinda isn't beyond a little manipulation to get the desired emotional response , and there are times when the storyline curves in preposterous directions .  on more than one occasion , it's apparent that events are occurring specifically to funnel the characters into a position where there is only one possible route .  coincidence is a crucial plot device ; without it , this movie can't go anywhere .  the voiceover narration ( never one of my favorite techniques ) is too verbose and breaks into the story at undesirable moments .   ( however , without it , the final twist , which i will not reveal , would not be as poignant . )  yet , despite these quibbles , i enjoyed oscar and lucinda .  storyline faults pale in the light of two such finely-realized characters .  thematically , the film is also strong .  the unifying motif -- that everything in life is a gamble -- is successfully delineated .  oscar and lucinda don't just wager their money , they bet their hearts , minds , and souls .  a card game they engage in shortly after they first meet could easily be considered a form of emotional " strip poker " where defenses are peeled away to reveal their shared , secret passion .  oscar does not see gambling as a vice .  in fact , he believes that the greatest chance one takes in life is betting one's immortal soul on the truth of a religious faith .  ralph fiennes , who normally plays strong , confident men , is very much at home as the fumbling , insecure oscar .  the actor brings a variety of nervous tics to the part , all of which subtly add to a vague sense of discomfort whenever oscar is on-screen .  as good as fiennes is , however , he is eclipsed by cate blanchett .  the actress , who appeared earlier this year as one of the leads in bruce beresford's paradise road , is mesmerizing as lucinda .  she gives this liberated woman her flash , and feeds the chemistry between the two lead characters so that it sparkles rather than fizzles .  effective support is provided by ciaran hinds ( the male lead in jane austen's persuasion ) as lucinda's close friend , tom wilkinson ( the full monty ) as oscar's mentor , and clive russell as a self-serving adventurer .  there's a real magic in the way armstrong develops the story , keeping things moving in unexpected directions without lingering too long on any one moment or sequence .   ( in fact , i wish she had devoted a little more time to the luminous middle act , which has oscar and lucinda together . )  with the skill of a consummate storyteller , she weaves romance , friendship , passion , humor , and tragedy together into a complete package .  the characters , with all of their human foibles and neuroses , are wonderfully developed by fiennes and blanchett .  so who cares if the storyline is a little ripe and unwieldy ?  oscar and lucinda still offers abundant pleasures to reward the viewer . 
neg@ pos neg this was the last carry on movie ( if you discount 'carry on columbus' as a carry on movie ) and was made by a new production company .  based in central london , this movie is about the attempts by emmanuelle prevert ( suzanne danielle ) to bed her husband emile the french ambassador ( kenneth williams ) .  when he seems unwilling , she is given his permission to bed anyone she likes , such as the prime minister and the u . s . ambassador .  her antics get her into trouble and the british press spread these rumours all over their front pages .  she is invited to talk on television to set the record straight but only confirms the rumours instead .  meanwhile , theodore valentine ( larry dann ) is in love with emmannuelle after a chance encounter in the toilet of the concorde and is determined to marry her .  however , she is only interested in restoring her husband's ardour which seems a little difficult after emile's accident with a church spire !  this film is the second worst carry on movie , the worst being 'carry on england' .  it is embarassing to see some of the remaining regulars struggle through this diabolical script by lance peters and try to pull off some of the crude and tasteless jokes that he has written .  newcomers suzanne danielle and beryl reid ( as mrs . valentine ) are mildly funny , but larry dann as theodore is excruciatingly bad .  kenneth williams only appears in a few scenes and his lacklustre performance is warranted , given the script .  the small parts for jack douglas as lyons the butler , joan sims as mrs . dangle , kenneth connor as leyland the chauffeur , and peter butterworth as richmond , are worthless and embarassing .  in fact , all four parts are surplus to requirements .  however , the only humourous scene in the film is when the four of them and emmannuelle talk about their most amourous escapades .  an awful script , a terrible collection of jokes , very poor production values ( especially the scene where emmannuelle takes her clothes off at st . james palace ) , a ludicrous and cringeworthy musical score , and a non-existent plot or storyline .  its just a succession of awful set pieces about who emmannuelle will bed next !  jack douglas is not so annoying but is more boring , joan sims and peter butterworth are wasted , and kenneth connor and kenneth williams put in some poor performances as leyland and emile .  a complete waste of time , this movie was trying to catch up with the new sexually permissive seventies .  it was a certificate 15 film but by 1978 , there was little interest in this kind of film and it flopped at the box office and was only given its premiere on uk terrestrial television in april 1998 !  avoid at all costs ! 
pos@ pos neg i can hear the question already .  what on earth do these two movies have in common ?  to most people , not a lot , except that both are by renowned directors .  as i saw them , however , both movies have flawed romantic scripts wrapped in distinctive packaging of lavish visuals musical numbers .  but oh , how differently the packages affect their films .  while " everyone's " production numbers make an otherwise ordinary woody tale something special , jane campion's imaginative visuals only serve to emphasize how pompous and uninvolving laura jones' script is .  i left " everyone says i love you " not remembering a lot about who loved whom , but its infectious happiness put a grin on my face .  i left " the portrait of a lady " not remembering a lot about who loved whom , and i could have cared less .   " everyone " features nothing allen hasn't done before storywise .  woody is again desperately in love with a beautiful woman ( roberts ) , and against the odds they manage to click for awhile before allen is left wondering what went wrong--again .  similar situations happen to his family and friends .  some of the more outlandish comedy scenes even hark back to his " early , funny " films .  the scenes between tim roth and drew barrymore could have come out of " take the money and run , " his directorial debut .  however , nothing allen has ever done prepared me for this one-of-a-kind display of sheer good spirits .  in fact , in this movie , the feeling itself is what's most important .  yes , the movie would have been better--among his very best , i think--if it had a meatier story .  but what it lacks in substance it makes up for in feeling .  and what better way to express feeling than through music ?  love is often best expressed in a song , and the numbers the cast break into here cut straight to the heart .  some are a tad too goofy , such as the number where a lot of ghosts prance around in a funeral parlor , but i admired allen for even putting them in there .  it also helps that as usual , allen has a top-flight cast working with him .  their singing voices range from quite good ( goldie hawn ) to not quite good ( allen ) to literally unlistenable ( barrymore , whose real voice was dubbed by a professional ) .  but while their vocal abilities differ , all the actors do a great job of putting joy up there on the screen , and making it rub off on the audience .  granted , some people will simply never accept characters singing in movies , but for those attuned to it , this film should work wonders .  jane campion , too , has a top-flight cast working for her in " portrait of a lady , " too , but even their considerable skills can do nothing to keep the film from being a stilted , virtually lifeless mess , albeit a visually interesting one .  campion and her cinematographer stuart dryburgh come up with a great variety of eye-filling images that linger in the mind .  unfortunately , what didn't linger in the mind for me was the story the visuals were supposed to be reflecting .  i remember very well shots of a train with its light beaming and shots of men vanishing around nicole kidman , but i can remember very little of what happened between all these people .  even worse , i don't find myself feeling bad that i've forgotten .  the problem , i think , lies not with the cast , which seemed to be trying very hard for the material .  it was the script that couldn't convince me to care about anyone .  the characters were putting out all kinds of emotion , but i found no reason to connect with any of them .  i understood that the story was about cold , emotionally vacant characters , but for me to care about them , i have to identify with them somehow and want them to inject feeling into their lives .  jones' script never simply gave me that opportunity .  in the end , it almost seemed as if campion was trying to inject some life of her own into the proceedings with her visual flourishes .  unfortunately , as she kept painting these dazzling pictures , they only served to push me further away from the material and remind me that there was no connection between me and the film .  in the end , the movie's one strength ended up hurting it .  so here we have two films with pretty uninteresting plots , and yet i was able to truly enjoy one of them .  why ?  with both films , my head cared about neither story , but only " everyone says i love you " was able to make my heart sing . 
neg@ pos neg while watching loser , it occurred to me that amy heckerling's true genius as a film-maker is casting .  in fast times at ridgemont high , she gave us sean penn's jeff spicoli ; in look who's talking , she turned bruce willis into a wise-cracking baby and provided john travolta with is first career revival ; in clueless , she found a star vehicle for the adorableness that is ( or was ) alicia silverstone .  she seems to understand instinctively how to find performers the audience will like in spite of their flaws .  unfortunately , she may also be starting to understand that she understands .  giving appealing actors an appealing script creates likeable movies .  giving appealing actors a script in which their appeal _is_ the movie makes for unexpectedly awful films like loser .  naturally , heckerling makes her protagonist an all-around swell guy .  paul tannek ( jason biggs ) is a small-town boy who gets a scholarship to nyu , then instantly finds himself an island of compassion and diligence in the cold-hearted big city .  paul is the kind of guy who gives up his seat on the subway to an elderly woman ; his roommates adam ( zak orth ) , chris ( tom sadoski ) and noah ( jimmi simpson ) are the kind of guys who blast their music and let their waterbeds leak all over paul .  paul is also the kind of guy who adores girls from afar , in this case the lovely dora diamond ( mena suvari ) .  dora has problems of her own , including a shortage of funds to pay her tuition and a relationship with a professor , edward alcott ( greg kinnear ) , that's more than slightly one-sided .  they're two conscientious kids who love animals and homeless people , so clearly they belong together , even if paul is a loser .  i must confess that , for a while , i was suckered in by heckerling's casting .  jason biggs is an engaging performer whose unconventional looks make him even easier to embrace ; suvari is a coquette with an undercurrent of intelligence .  they're pleasant enough to watch , and heckerling gives us plenty of scenes establishing how nice they are and how nice their respective antagonists aren't .  then it gradually becomes clear that there's virtually nothing to loser but scenes of that sort .  in theory , loser is a romantic comedy , but there is scarcely a laugh to be found in the entire film ( notable exception : a cameo by a scene-stealing comic actor as a video store clerk ) .  instead of taking any time to make the characters' situations funny , heckerling spends 98 minutes making her characters' situations pathetic .  she shows none of the ear for quirky dialogue that sparked clueless , nor any of that film's interest in lively plotting ( not surprisingly , since clueless's plot came via jane austen's emma ) .  she simply turns the film into a pity party .  since loser is a film composed almost entirely of establishing character , you might think that those characters would be interesting , or at least slightly complicated .  instead , you have people either so perfect or so unredeemable that there's no reason to watch them .  paul isn't just a nice guy , he's flawless ; consequently , he's a central character who does absolutely no growing .  his roommates aren't just inconsiderate , they're actively evil-blackmailing professor alcott , drugging women with rohypnol and generally giving humanity a bad name .  and professor alcott isn't just manipulative , he turns dora into his house slave .  dora's unthinking devotion to alcott is the only whiff of basic human frailty to be found in loser , and even that isn't explored in sufficient detail .  there's more ambiguity in the 30-second snippet from alan cumming's broadway performance as the emcee in cabaret then there is in the rest of loser it's one thing to turn supporting characters into comic exaggerations ; it's another to flatten your leads into easily digestible mush .  and it would help if those comic exaggerations were somehow . . .  i don't know . . .  comic .  still , i spent much of the film holding out the ridiculous hope that heckerling would somehow salvage loser from its tedium and justify my desire to like paul and dora .  that hope dissolved the moment heckerling underscored a sequence of paul in the throes of unrequited love to simon and garfunkel's " scarborough fair/canticle . "  instead of giving the sequence a knowing wink-a reference to the graduate , a hint that paul is becoming an overly-sensitive clich-heckerling plays it deadly straight .  even in the scenes that scream for a light comic touch and a bit of a poke at her protagonist's foibles , she finds it impossible to stray from the gospel of paul as saint .  clueless's cher had her self-absorption and manipulative tendencies to balance her cuteness .  in loser , amy heckerling shows a leaden hand with material that demands friskiness ( her one show of wit involves naming paul's dorm " hunt's hall " after erstwhile bowery boy huntz hall ) .  her gift with casting proved to be her curse .  loser may be a crashing bore , but gee , aren't those two kids swell ? 
pos@ pos neg the booming introduction music finishes , and the camera sweeps over red mountains .  we see two figures looking over a barren , and very red landscape .  they kiss , then walk on .  one of the characters ( schwarzenegger ) slips , and falls .  the glass on his mask cracks .  his face scruches up , and his eye's begin to pop . . . . .  then doug quaid , played by schwarzenegger , wakes up .  it's all been a dream .  he wakes up next to his beautiful wife , played by stone , and the film begins . . .  total recall is a typical sci-fi film wrapped around an intresting ( if far fetched ) plot .  quaid , who has never been to mars , keeps on having dreams of the planet , which has now been colanised .  one day , while riding on a train , he's see's a ad for a company called 'rekall' , which implants memories of a holiday , instead of you actually going there yourself .  quaid chooses the 'secret agent on mars' memory , and then the s * * * really hits the fan .  the implant goes wrong , and quaid really thinks he is an agent on mars for about two minutes , until he goes back to normal and can't remember a thing .  however , everyone he knows ( his workmates , his wife ) turn against him , saying how 'blabbed about mars' and 'blew his cover on the mission' a strange man , called richter , played by ironside , wants to kill him .  quaid , now hopelessly confused , follows the advice given to him , by a 'friend' .  he get's his ass to mars .  mars is ruled by cohagen , played by cox , who charges people for air .  against him are the rebels , who are mainly mutants .  the rebel's need quaid to defeat cohagen , because quaid knows ( but can't remember yet ) about a reactor that produces air .  eventually , quaid kills cohagen , turns on the reactor , saves the planet , and goes away with a beautiful girl , just like the guy at rekall promised him .  throughout this plot , there is huge explosions , thousands of deaths ( and i mean a lot of death ) swearing , sex , and everything else that make's a good verhoeven ( director of basic instinct and starship troopers ) movie .  naturally , there's some pretty imaginative deaths , with arms getting ripped off , someone getting drilled , and heads exploding .  as you can tell , it's violent stuff .  but it's done so stylishly , and of course arnie tones it down with a one liner , that's it excusable .  the acting is variable .  arnie , of course , is useless , but he goes has some good lines , and in the first twenty minutes , he even act's like a normal bloke , not like some action hero .  stone , of course , is useless , making a pretty poor wife , and a pretty poor action hero .  but , she does sex scenes alright .  ticoton ( most recently seen in con air ) , again , is ok , doing some good action , but getting her emotions all wrong .  one minute she hates quaid , the next she loves him , and she never gets this tranisition right .  so , the good guys are awful .  but , the bad guy's are excellent .  cox is basically reprising robocop , but he's still great in this , and he delivers the best line in the whole film near the end .  ironside is superbly evil , with an utterly emotionless face .  the supporting cast are fine , and not even the comedy sidekick ( this time in the form of a taxi driver ) is annoying .  one disappointing aspect , though , are the special effects .  ilm and dreamquest do some good work ( such as a subway station scene ) but the model work is not so good .  some of the model heads look appaling fake , and quatto is a major disappointment .  another irritating thing is the product placement .  there are a lot of plugs ( and a good mars today gag ) however , the sets look great , and the special effects at the end of the film aren't too bad either .  there's also a good soundtrack running through , by jerry goldsmith ( the omen , poltergeist , star trek : the motion picture )  overall , then , total recall is a hugely violent , yet hugely enjoyable , action fest , with a reasonable plot thrown in there too , some great bad guys , and some imaganitive death .  for a schwarzenegger movie , this is not bad at all .  in fact , it's very good .

pos@ pos neg there seem to be two reactions to dark city .  you either love it or you are unimpressed .  count me as a " love it . "  as good as the crow and spawn are , dark city is better .  where the former two have a specific comic-book following , the latter is an original work with the potential for broader appeal .  it has a similar look to the others , but dark city is much more thoughtful and much less violent .  not clever or complex , the story is still fascinating , like a selection from the twilight zone .  a man ( rufus sewell ) is awakened in his bathtub by a man with a syringe .  surprised , the attacker runs off .  the dazed man gets out of the tub and finds a woman's body in the room .  a mysterious caller warns him to leave the apartment immediately , so he packs some clothes and leaves , never sure why he's leaving or what he's fleeing .  ghoulish figures in long coats recognize the man and chase him through the dark city , hounding him like figures in a nightmare .  an odd blast of willpower allows the man to dream himself free from his pursuers long enough to check his i . d .  the amnesiac learns that he is not dreaming and that his name is john murdoch .  now if only he could remember the rest of his life . . . .  dark city is good on many levels .  first , the look of the movie is excellent .  give credit to production designers george liddle and patrick tatopolous for creating a coherent look from diverse elements .  there are visual elements from the american 1920s-60s , mixed with dickens-era urban industrial elements .  it is all pulled together in a sad , dark look reminiscent of the diner in edward hopper's painting , nighthawks .  proyas' use of models gives an appropriately eerie unreality to the film's world ( for not only does the audience see the city a model , but so do the ghouls ) .  the look is like a cross between tim burton's batman and the bleak animation of the brothers quay .  second , the editing of the film is good .  the pacing is on track , and the plot is revealed , the " amnesia " explained , in satisfying increments .  also , the stylized editing within each scene gives the movie a tense , caffeinated look .  third , the special effects are well used .  they look good , but more importantly , the right effects are used for the right job .  one example stands out in my mind : the coated figures who haunt the city can attack telekinetically .  a simple ripple effect is used .  a more showy effect could have been chosen , but then it would have just been gratuitous .  restraint was shown where necessary , letting the more critical effects look more impressive .  finally , like gattaca , dark city spends a just a little effort striving for mythical significance .  unlike gattaca , the story is just open-ended and non-literal enough to be successful .  john murdoch's recovery from amnesia is tied to the passing of the night , and the hopeful coming of the dawn .  his struggle with amnesia is both figuratively and literally the struggle of all mankind ( at least in his world ) .  when we finally see the big picture of the movie's world , it is as mysterious as the iroquois image of the world being carried on the back of a giant turtle .  a few minor flaws keep me from giving this movie the same perfect score roger ebert gave , but i do strongly recommend it , for its look , its pace , its story , and its timelessness .

pos@ pos neg this is a good year if you want plenty of sci-fi on your multiplex .  >from the comedies mars attacks and men in black , to luc besson's powerful the fifth element , and to this , sci-fi/horror that is event horizon .   ( more is on the way with contact and alien : ressurection being released later this year . )  the story is thus : in 2040 an explorer ship called the event horizon tests out a newly invented gravity drive .  a device that enables a craft to travel anywhere in the universe , instantaneously .  this is achieved by creating a gateway , infact , a black hole , between the craft and it's required destination .  in this case , from near neptune to proxima prime .  however , when the event horizon attempts this , it dissappears , without trace , leaving two searches for it fruitless .  seven years later , it reappears , transmitting a distress signal and this is where the film starts .  a search and rescue ship is sent out to investigate .  the team is led by laurence fishburne , and joining them is sam neill who plays the scientist that invented the gravity drive .  as the team search the event horizon , they find no trace of the crew but plenty of blood lying around .  not a good sign . . .  to make matters worse , as they search the ship , they find themselves being subjected to a series of illusions based on their own individual inner secrets and worse , some very bloody events start to occur as they slowly piece together the events that transpired on the ship seven years ago .  it soon becomes apparent that , wherever the ship went , it bought something back with it .  something very , very evil . . .  the first thing you'll notice in this film is it's incredible visual effects .  they really are eye popping , with some great models to boot .  the acting is quite good , with some occasional witty moments .  sam neill does a good job as the scientist that increasingly becomes more and more disturbed as the search continues , but a tip of the hat goes to laurence fishburne who leads the team , in a cool , calm , take no nonense manner .  it is his acting skills that help hold this film together .  the idea behind event horizon is certainly a good one .  it starts off incredibly well , but the middle section becomes quite confused and sometimes muddled , leaving the viewer unsure on just what the reasons are behind some of the bloody and bizarre events that occur .  however , the closing 20 minutes of the film more than make up for this , producing one the most nail biting ( or in my case , straw of my drink biting ! )  climaxes i've recently witnessed .  overall , event horizon is a smart film indeed .  it's very enjoyable and has some amazing visuals .  but be warned , the horror scenes , despite being very brief are very , very , gory .  not for the squemish ! 
neg@ pos neg starring william baldwin ; cindy crawford & steven berkoff all right , the first problem that fair game has is the casting of supermodel cindy crawford in the lead role .  not that cindy does that bad , it's just that anyone who watches this film knows from moment one that that little bit of casting was not done because of cindy's extraordinary acting skills , but for her extraordinary ability to look drop dead gorgeous in any situation .  and in fair game most situations tend to find cindy either soaking wet or very hot and sweaty , but i'm sure that that is just a coincidence , no doubt that these situations were essential to the plot and the fact that cindy looks great wet , well , that's just a happy coincidence .  sure .  william baldwin isn't a bad actor .  unfortunately , he just doesn't demonstrate it at all in this movie .  i'm not sure if that's because most of his lines were just so hokey , or if he was trying to make cindy's acting look good .  if it was the latter , it worked .  cindy does a surprisingly good job here in her first movie .  which is not to say that she doesn't have room for improvement .  although to be fair to cindy , her lines were kinda cheesy in places .  so right about now you are no doubt asking yourself what sort of movie does cindy crawford , arguably the most beautiful woman on the planet , chose for her foray into the world of cinema ?  well , i'm glad you asked that question .  cindy plays a lawyer who by some convoluted plot twists becomes a target for former elite kgb agents .  why woud they target someone as likable as cindy , you ask ?  by the end of the movie you won't care .  the story is so contrived it isn't funny .  anyway after cindy gets blown out of the window of her house , without getting so much as a scratch i might add , she is placed into protective police custody under the watchful eve of william baldwin .  who's character , max kilpatric , a police detective , seems to possess the skills of some sort of fighting machine ( my guess is that the writers have seen way too many of steven seagal's early films ) .  the point is that the idea of the crawford and baldwin's characters of the run from these killer russians isn't all that bad of an idea , it's just everything around that basic idea which kinda stinks out loud .  the supporting cast members are nothing more that over acted stereotypes .  if i was baldwin , i'd hope this film disappears .  as for crawford , she may indeed have some acting ability .  unfortunately , any she does have is obscured by writing that goes beyond bad .  this movie was obviously written with cindy in mind , since the writers spend most of their time finding ways to capitalize off of her looks .  it's too bad they hadn't spent more time on a half decent plot , since ms . crawford is more than capable of looking just fine all by herself thank you very much .  unless you are a huge fan of either baldwin or crawford this is a movie that will only disappoint you .

neg@ pos neg a slight romantic comedy with a feminist bent , but one with no edge to it .  it turns out to be a conventional film filled with the usual clich ? s and stock characters of this genre .  though it's a well-written and well-acted fluff piece , it still does not have too much to say that is surprising .  it's made for the gentle art-house set , those who don't want something too disturbing to think about .  it's about a critically successful writer husband , alec ( pryce ) , who is so self-absorbed that he's threatened by his department store floor-walking model wife , kate ( bouquet ) , who wants to be a writer .  she meets his crass publisher , vanni corso ( walken ) , another self-absorbed man , and a predictable relationship occurs .  the fireworks occur because she outgrows her husband's first impressions of her as someone who was impressed with his genius and worships at his feet .  she now wants her own identity and her independence .  the film looked like the usual sitcom stuff , and is plagued with the cheap set design features reserved for a tv movie .  the film sagged in the middle of the story from the weight of its tedium , and eventually landed on its rear end with its unspectacular climax .  it's set in london , and it opens as model kate rebuffs sexual advances by a wealthy american shopper , vanni .  she later meets him as her hubby's new upstart publisher who seeks to have her intellectual author husband in his stable in order to give him credibility as a publisher of quality , and he quickly wins favor with her by publishing her vanity novel .  alec who is an obnoxious grouse , someone whom it seems it would be impossible to live with , tries to do everything to stop his wife from having her book published--which only pushes her into the grasping arms of vanni .  the publisher is proud that he's a mamma's boy who never married and is a self-made man who has earned millions .  he has recently acquired a failing old london publishing house and plans to revitalize it , as he proudly tells kate : " if my father could sell pizzas in harlem , i could sell culture in europe . "  the only thing that couldn't be sold , is this stiff story and tired plot line .  the mystery to me , is how the lovely kate could like either man unless she was an insensitive dummy .  she soon divorces the beleaguered alec and marries the soon-to-become-beleaguered vanni .  when she writes a second novel , he rebuffs her the same way her first hubby did .  it ends with the same results that happened to hubby number one , as its story of ambition and lust winds down in a whimper .  a business affair was loosely based on the real-life literary and romantic travails of married authors barbara skelton and cyril connolly , in their celebrated 1950s love triangle . 
pos@ pos neg since their film debut in 1984 with the tightly wrought texas thriller " blood simple , " joel and ethan coen have been one of the most eclectic , original , and downright fascinating creative teams in modern hollywood .  their films are highly stylized , deeply embedded in a particular time and place , and their characters are more often than not everyday people who get caught up in highly unusual circumstances .  in " the big lebowski , " their first cinematic offering since the multiple academy award-winning " fargo , " the action takes place in los angeles during the gulf war , and the hero of the story is jeff lebowski , aka the dude .  the dude is played by jeff bridges -- one of hollywood's most underrated actors -- in the best stoned performance since sean penn stumbled through the halls of ridgemont high .  the dude is a simple man who has never quite made it out of the sixties .  he has shaggy , shoulder-length hair , a grizzled goatee badly in need of a trim , and he wears mostly stained tee-shirts , long shorts , and gellies without socks .  he smokes a lot of pot , drinks a lot of white russians , and is more than content to spend the majority of his time bowling with his two buddies , a slightly psychotic vietnam vet named walter sobchak ( john goodman ) and donny ( steve buscemi ) , one of those guys who always wants to be part of the conversation , but never quite makes it in .  one day , the dude is confused with another jeff lebowski ( david huddleston ) , this one being a millionaire philanthropist whose trophy wife , bunny ( tara reid ) , owes a lot of people a lot of money .  the main plot and all its accompanying side-plots and coenesque diatribes are far too complicated to get into here .  suffice to say that the dude becomes deeply involved with the big lebowski when bunny is kidnaped and the dude is asked to be a courier for the ransom money .  by the time all is said and done , walter has become deeply involved , as has the big lebowski's daughter , maude ( julianne moore ) , a feminist performance artist , a pornographer named jackie treehorn ( ben gazzara ) , and a group of german nihilists led by peter stormare , who was so great as the silent but deadly kidnaper in " fargo . "   " the big lebowski " plays like an amalgam of all the coen brothers' earlier efforts .  it shares their previous films' strong sense of time and place , as well as their send-ups of movie genres and political and cultural ideologies .   " lebowski " has the same kind of crazed caricatures that made " raising arizona " such a hoot ; it has surrealistic dream sequences ( one of which involves a busby berkley-like dance number ) that characterized the ending of " barton fink " ; and it has the same kind of cartoonish look and feel that pervaded " the hudsucker proxy . "  the film was shot by veteran cinematographer roger deakins , who has worked with the coens on three other films , " barton fink , " " the hudsucker proxy , " and " fargo . "  deakins always gives the coens' films a distinctive visual style , and here he does a brilliant job of capturing the bright colors of seedy los angeles in the early nineties , whether that by the obnoxious blue bowling suit worn by the dude's main competitor jesus quintana ( john turturro ) , or the strikingly manic dream sequences , one of which involves the dizzy spectacle of watching a strike from a bowling ball's point of view .  if " fargo " was the coen brothers' most restrained effort in years , " the big lebowski " marks their return to over-the-edge filmmaking .  it is overflowing with style and attitude , which helps make up for the scattered plot fragments that never quite come together in the end .  the coens fill the screen with lighting , set design , music , and hilarious performances from all the leads , especially bridges and the always reliable john goodman , who shows real comic timing in his untimely 'nam-inspired outbursts and his intense dedication to his adopted judaism .  with joel directing , ethan producing , and both writing , the coen brothers seem limitless in their capacity to turn our world inside out .  their talent lies not in their ability to reflect the norms of reality , but in their potential to dig out the darkest corners of life and bring them to light .  the coens rejoice in the oddballs of the world , and they put them center-stage to show that it's not just guys like the dude who are nuts , but the entire planet . 
neg@ pos neg as the twin surfer dudes , stew and phil deedle , lay bandaged and unconscious in the hospital , phil comes to first and chooses the coolest way to wake his brother .  yanking out his iv , he uses it like a water pistol to soak his brother's face .  this bit of lame physical humor is typical of disney's meet the deedles , a movie more to be endured that watched .   ( i stopped looking at my wife during the screening , since every time i did , she'd start sticking her finger in her throat .  and she's right , it is that bad . )  directed without any imagination by steve boyum , whose long background in film is mainly in stunts and in second unit direction , the film limps along at best .  boyum attempts to keep the pace moving by staging stunts , stunts and more stunts .  amazingly for someone with his background , he seems incapable of finding any fresh ones , and we have a car go off the road five different times -- maybe more .  but who's counting ?  and then there is the script by james herzfeld , whose only other film , tapeheads from a decade ago , was so awful that it is considered a cult classic .  meet the deedles , however , is painfully bad rather than laughably bad .  it will probably be in and out of the theaters like a tornado and is in no danger of becoming a classic anything .  herzfeld treats us to gratingly abysmal dialog that includes " your geyser's a geezer , " and " i'd like to put a deedle in her haystack . "  as the movie opens , the twins , who at one point describe themselves modestly as " a walking kodak moment , " are celebrating their 18th birthday .  as they ride a parasail high above the waters of waikiki , a truant officer pursues them on his jet ski .  as heirs to the fabulous fortune of the deedle empire , the boys are sent by their father to camp broken spirit at yellowstone to transform the two laid-back beach bums into men .  as they arrive in their wetsuits in yellowstone , they've got their surfboards , skateboards , and a hawaiian drink machine the size of an armoire .  their camp has gone out of business , but they are mistaken for new park rangers .  the rest of the movie has them fighting the park's overpopulation of prairie dogs as well as a deranged ex-ranger , played by dennis hopper , who is out to stop old faithful before its billionth birthday celebration , scheduled for later in the week .  hopper , who has made some wonderful movies , carried away being a recent favorite , does have a propensity for choosing some truly odoriferous material .  this isn't his worst acting , but meet the deedles is arguably the worst movie he's ever been in .  steve van wormer and paul walker , as stew and phil , give lifeless performances .  the only actor in the movie with any demonstrable talent is a cute little prairie dog named petey .  even the cinematography by david hennings is so prosaic that it manages to make yellowstone look dull .  to add insult to injury , hennings is fond of inappropriate close-ups , which only serve to remind us of the inanity of the dialog .  put a ten-foot pair of lips on the screen , and you naturally pay extra attention to what is said .  although boyum says in the notes that he is proud that his film is appropriate for families , one wonders how many skateboarders will attempt the movie's stunt of lying on your back on a skateboard while negotiating a busy and twisting mountain road .  they make it look like so much fun that i'm sure many will try some variation of the stunt .   " how could this possibly be worst , " asks phil .  just when you suspect it can't , the movie takes a turn further downhill .  its low point may have you looking for an airline barf bag .  after phil's girlfriend digs up a big mount of moist soil , they suck in a long worm .  like the two dog lovers eating spaghetti in lady and the tramp , their lips finally meet in a kiss .  as they pull back , their faces are full of the dirt that encased the worm they have just ingested .  meet the deedles runs about an hour and a half .  it is rated pg for a little bathroom humor and would be acceptable for kids around 6 and up .  my son jeffrey and his friend nickolas , both almost 9 , gave the show * * * .  they both thought the scenes with petey were among their favorites .  nickolas also mentioned the scene in which the circus bear drives a jeep , and jeffrey especially liked the one in which the circus elephant was referred to as dumbo . 
pos@ pos neg the sweet hereafter could serve as a textbook example of the difference between television movies and " real " movies .  consider for a moment what a television producer would do with a book that features a fatal school bus accident and a lawyer out to sign up the bereaved -- lots of hot sensationalism interrupted with breaks to sell beer and toothpaste .  top-flight writer and director atom egoyan delivers instead a film with tremendous power whose most notable trait is its touching subtlety .  based on a respected book of the same name by author russell banks , the movie represents a rethinking of the story's structure , not merely a literal adaptation of the novel .  told in linear form by four narrators in the book , egoyan's version happens instead in overlapping time sequences and without a narrator .  the author is even on record as applauding egoyan's changes .  in the press notes the book's author describes the story as " a parable of lost children . "  he says it asks what a town does in the absence of its children .  picking up on this , egoyan has a flashback in which a sitter , nicole burnell , played with grace by sarah polley , reads parts of " the pied piper " from an old , illustrated book to her two charges .  periodically throughout the picture , nicole's readings are heard in voice-over .  you have never heard this moving poem read so sweetly or in such an appropriate moment .  they and the rest of the town's children come into harm's way -- some live and others are seriously injured .  and the entire small canadian town where the accident occurs is never the same again .  although the physical damage is inflicted mainly on the children , the adults bear the emotional scars of the loss .  ian holm , in arguably the best performance of his distinguished career , plays mitchell stephens , an intense man of quiet misery .  mitchell is the outsider in the story set in a small , snow-encrusted community in the british columbian wilderness .  his mission there is a singular one , to sign up the parents so that he can sue someone , anyone , on their behalf .  if this seems crass , well it is , but mitchell approaches his job with the dedication of a religious zealot .  the story unfolds slowly and always believably .  each little aspect has its own fascination .  as mitchell interviews wendell and rita walker , played with quiet realism by maury chaykin and alberta watson , he has a simple task .  he wants them to suggest some model couple in the village who has a lost a child so that he can use that couple to form the basis of the suit .  wendell ticks off one town member after another and then , as one can in a small town , enumerates each person's numerous faults .  although the town is no peyton place , people there do have their foibles .  one of the best parents in the town appears to be billy ansell ( bruce greenwood ) , who rides his pickup behind the school bus everyday just so he can wave good-bye to his kids .  well , single parent billy's fault is that he has regularly scheduled trysts with the married rita .  his confessions to rita about his feelings of loss are one of the many heartfelt outpourings in the story .  the accident itself , a simple one of a bus hitting a patch of ice , isn't shown until the middle of the picture , but , nevertheless , the mystery about it builds throughout the film .  although the picture is no detective story , finding out exactly what happened is a subtheme in a movie that is primarily a character study of a town gripped by tragedy .  as the injured bus driver , gabrielle rose , dolores driscoll plays the role of a dedicated individual who loves kids with a passion and for whom the tragedy takes on special meaning .  to round out the story , mitchell has his own private tragedy to bear .  his daughter zoe ( caerthan banks ) is a drug addict who has bounced in and out of one half-way house and recovery center after another .  fond of calling her dad on his cell phone so she can ask for money or help , she interrupts him at many emotionally charged moments as he attempts to sign up the townsfolk .   ( " i can help you , " mitchell tries to reassure billy .   " not unless you can raise the dead , " billy snaps back .  mitchell's pitch is never an easy one and worrying about zoe only makes it harder . )  mychael danna's haunting music sets the stage for tragedy .  the cinematography by paul sarossy is sweeping in its outdoor grandeur , but it is in the warm , shadowy , intimate moments indoors where it works best .  the show , which is ripe for emotional manipulation , never plays with its audience .  still , when the house lights go up , you may feel as i did .  i could barely breathe ; i was so overcome by the sum total of what i had witnessed .  more than anything , the film is like a master painting .  each cinematic brush stroke is carefully laid down by egoyan with the beauty building with each dollop of paint .  with the final color in place , the masterpiece is complete , and the ending credits roll .  the sweet hereafter runs 1 : 50 .  it is rated r for mature themes , sexuality and some profanity and would be fine teenagers . 
neg@ pos neg the last line ( or near to that honor ) is the great butler , alfred ( the ubergod , michael gough ) saying , " i think we need a bigger bat cave , " or something to that note .  that's exactly what this film is - too big for its own good because it has too damn much .  cut batgirl out .  cut one of the villains .  it's too much to handle in one dosage .  it's so much that characters get left behind .  poor elle gets a mere 3 scenes and a subplot which is introduced but never finished in any way , shape or form .  and elle deserves better .  this is the fourth in the gigantic film series and the second from director joel schumacher .  it's also the fourth worst in the series ( and second worst from joel ) .  the series has been declining since its stunning debut , followed by the almost-as-stunning sequel and then the anti-climactic third one ( first by joel ) .  this one's not anti-climactic - i knew it was gonna suck .  it's up to joel to make it fun though .   " batman forever " was fun .  this is a big bore of over-produced action sequences and shallow characters .  i mean , this one bit .  i'm gonna put all the plot in one paragraph : mr . freeze ( ah-nold ) , who's wife was dying of some disease , has become the new big villain these days .  he's a huge ex-scientist who fell into some weird liquid ( hello ?  joker ? ) and now has a body temperature of a big fat zero and has a blue body .  batman ( george ) and robin ( chris ) fight him a bit but find they're growing apart .  meanwhile , another villain shows up , poison ivy ( uma ! ) , who was a dorky scientist chick working on flowers in south america with a twistet scientist ( john glover ) who kills her when she finds out he's used her research to develop an uberman , bane , who is basically a man pumped with chemicals which probably killed any personality he ever had .  she emerges from her chemicals ( don't ask 'cause i can't tell ya ) as a sexy woman ( the real uma ) who's poison when or if you kiss her and has some aphrodiasiatic scent she blows at people .  she starts to tear away at the dynamic duo .  meanwhile , alfred's dying of the same disease mr . freeze's wife has ( but in an earlier state than she ) , and his niece , barbara ( alicia ) , comes all the way from oxford without an english accent to get him away from the butler trade , but soon ( well , not really soon , it takes her 2 hours ) becomes batgirl .  meanwhile , in an unfinished subplot , bruce ( batman's alter-ego , if you forgot ) has been dating the lovely julie madison ( the even lovlier elle macpherson ) who wants a commitment after a year but he says nothing .  end of her for all we know .  mr . freeze ultimately teams with poison ivy and they want to freeze the world and then take it over growing new plants as their population ( don't ask ! ! ! ) .  the trio must team together " as family " to beat them .  there ya go .  not the whole story but no big context clues .  too much , right ?  right !  the films seems patched together of nice little ideas which would have made for a couple good sequels .  however , while tim burton nicely balanced the villain/batman storyline ( although not wonderfully ) , joel seems to do almost nothing with batman in this one .  he gets some corny speeches , a couple clever lines and that's it .  maybe some stunts .  for all this , i can't even comment on george clooney as batman - i hardly saw the guy !  and when i did , he had horrible dialogue to say .  i think michael keaton is the quintessential batman but val kilmer was too robotic and fake as batman in the last episode .  george is in between them .  he's not quintessential , he's not horrible , he's good .  but i'm sure next time when they decide to renovate the series since they'll be critically murdered for this sorry effort , we'll get a good script and clooney will shine ( if he still has the job ) .  the villains are the only interesting part of the series according to schumacher .  last time , we had the brawn of two face as played by tommy lee jones and the brains/comedy supplied by the riddler as realized by jim carrey .  this time we have a somewhat sympathetic and somewhat hatable villain ( the same guy ) , mr . freeze .  we feel bad for his mental/physical collapse but does he really need to kill everyone for plants ?  arnold isn't very good - too hokey but kinda sympathetic at some points .  when he watches old movies of his wife , he actually looks somber .  wow .  but uma makes the most of her seductive character , getting the right point between hamminess and seductiveness .  it's like she's almost parodying herself in " pulp fiction " at points .  she's incredibly hot and makes the movie pretty much a star better .  as for the lower bat-people , chris is the same as he was in " batman forever , " although i think his work in these is too hokey when he's best at quieter parts in " scent of a woman " or just plain cool parts in " fried green tomotoes . "  alicia - i love the girl but she's not particularly good in this film .  she can hypotheitically act , we all saw that in " clueless , " but her lines kinda sound weird .  and it isn't the mushy-mouth this time .  but in all fairness , she has virtually no part .  joel gets around to her occasionally and when she's on , she does stupid stuff . . . although  i know i'm not the only one who loved the catfight between her and uma . . .  and poor elle .  poor , poor elle .  i love that woman and she can also hypothetically act ( for those of us who saw " sirens " ) .  but she has no part ! ! !  it seems like joel had so much footage that he had to edit almost an hour out of the final product .  there are no " couch " scenes ( like my best friend noticed ) .  now listen to me on this one - in every " batman " flick , there's a couch scene .  in the original , it was with vicki .  in " returns , " it was a good make-out scene with selena .  and in the last one , it was a chat with nicole .  this one , it's nothing .  and batgirl does next-to-nothing in this film till the end when she's suddenly " part of the family . "  fortunately , we get a lot of alfred .  he's the always reliable butler , in case you didn't know , who has been with bruce all his life .  he's a god .  he's a father figure .  he's also dying .  this got to me .  i love alfred almost as much as bruce and to see him in a robe , not in his tux , and freaking dying just gets to me .  we also get the idea that he might have been unhappy the whole time . . . but  this is never answered , as this film is too cluttered .  but in defense , it does have some good parts , other than uma .  for one , george is a good batman but unfortunately gets nothing to do .  and there are some nice touches .  when they show the asylum at one point , they show the patient's belongings in a room and we see the riddler's costume .  i laughed .  and during a biker scene ( involving robin and batgirl - another subplot never handled past initiation period ) , we not only see coolio but a bunch of bad-asses dressed as " droogs " from " a clockwork orange . "  i laughed at all these .  the film falls apart around the five-minute mark during an enormously long action sequence which must last around 20 minutes . . . or  did it just feel like that ?  the film should serve as another in the long-line of films which demonstrate that we need more intelligent films nowadays .  people are fed up with stupid films .  that's why the word of mouth killed " the lost world ! "  that's why last year , indy films grossed more than ever .  that's why this will have a strong box-office initative from people who just want to see it , like me , but will die after a week or two when the word around the grapevine kills it .  that's why the next two big-budget aciton pics are john woo's " face/off " and barry sonnenfeld's " men in black , " both which are the first two to catch on to the wave early on .  i like joel schumacher more as a person than an artiste .  i like some of his films ( " flatliners , " " a time to kill " ) but a lot of them suck .  he's a really eccentric person and i loved one of his quotes about how he admits to being a mediocre director and that's what makes him great .  but his costuming for woody allen's " sleeper " was more interesting than this one ( and his costuming was cool - look for the nazi number ) .  i love the " batman " series .  the first two rocked and i did like the last one .  but this one is not going to be one that i watch repeatedly like the other three .  hopefully , this will also serve as a springboard to a better batman next time .  and maybe they'll get smart and bring back catwoman .  and michael keaton .  but we can only hope . 
pos@ pos neg i saw simon birch in a basically sold out theater , on a sunday afternoon .  when the movie was over and the audience was exiting , i didn't hear one negative comment , and i didn't have any to offer .  simon birch is primarily about the friendship of two twelve year old boys , simon ( ian michael smith ) and joe ( joseph mazzello ) , and what destiny holds for both of them .  simon is a dwarf , who was not supposed to last through the night after birth due to a weak heart .  surprisingly , he does , and now constantly reminds everyone that he is a living miracle .  simon thinks god has a plan for him , a purpose for his life , and his condition , he just doesn't know what .  joe is an illegitimate child ( referred to both comically and dramatically throughout the film as a bastard ) , who's mom ( ashley judd ) won't tell him who his father is .  simon has more than just dwarfism as a problem , the people in the town don't really like him , because he isn't " natural " .  even his own parents don't care about him , and are disappointed they didn't have a " normal " son .  he is also harassed in church by the local pastor , rev . russell ( david strathairn ) and simon's chain smoking sunday school teacher played by jan hooks .  the only person , other than joe , that really cares for simon is joe's mom , who he also looks up to as a mother .  it would be just simon's luck , that he would accidentally kills joe's mom , something you are told at the beginning of the movie .  joe , now motherless as well as fatherless , feels the need to find out who his real father is .  with the help of ben ( oliver platt ) , the local drama teacher and joe's mom's current boyfriend ( before her death ) , he will attempt to locate his dad and get in a little trouble on the way .  most of this trouble is laugh out loud funny , although not all of it is .  simon will also look for god's plan for him , although he loses a little faith along the way .  starring in the first ( and last ) five minutes of the film is hollywood's newest dramatic actor , jim carrey .  jim plays the adult version of joe and does a impressive job starting the film off , and then tying it up just right .  this is the first character jim has played that is not over the top in anyway , and he does a commendable job .  simon birch is written and directed by mark steven johnson , this is his first film as director , but he has written several films , including the grumpy old men series .  he does an outstanding writing and directing job here , the film's structure is flawless and its flows together perfectly .  the dialog goes from extremely funny to morose without missing a beat .  the cast is excellent .  joseph mazzello gives the stand out performance .  joseph is outstanding for someone of any age , not alone someone who just turned 15 .  ian michael smith , in his film debut , has such a strong physical presence that you believe he is simon without any hesitation .  other great performances are turned in by the rest of the supporting cast .  i loved this movie , it is far and away one of the best films i have seen all year .  take your whole family to see simon birch , it is a magnificent film- an american masterpiece . 
neg@ pos neg synopsis : melissa , a mentally-disturbed woman who likes to smoke , seduces doug , a minor-league baseball player who likes to study anatomy , work on motorcycles , and make out with his girlfriend in a public library .  when doug decides to stop seeing her , melissa maliciously takes revenge on those around him , including his girlfriend , his mother , and his cat .  comments : malicious , i suppose , is an acceptable moview for what it is : a cheap , b-movie thriller which rips off dozens and dozens of spurned-psycho-lover-who-wants-revenge films ( like fatal attraction , hand that rocks the cradle , etc . etc . ) that have come before it .  malicious , however , really doesn't provide very many particularly suspenseful moments .  the plot starts off energetically enough , the main characters are introduced and the affair between doug and melissa begins and ends pretty early on in the film .  it starts to drag , unfortunately , after this .  melissa will obviously try to take her revenge on doug ( as always seems to happen in movies like these ) , but she does so in unimaginative ways that have been done in other , better thrillers before .  she drugs someone .  she kills a family pet and leaves it in the girlfriend's apartment .  and , of course , she stalks , so we see a number of shots , which are supposed to be suspenseful , where she's spying on doug and his girlfriend .  i won't reveal the ludicrous ending to this turkey , but i warn you that it's both painfully obvious and a real yawner .  john vernon does a remarkably good job at playing the not-so-bright baseball jock who initially gets swept away by melissa ( one of the script's faults is to try to pass off a character like this as a pre-med student ) .  the same cannot be said , though , for molly ringwald .  at times , she can effectively pull off the obsessed lover routine , especially during her silent , i'm-going-to-stare-you-down scenes .  at other times , however , she just seems somehow goofy and out of place .  in one particular scene which i guess was supposed to be suspenseful , she screeches " f--k you , you b-----d " and throws a phone .  she delivers the line so ridiculously that one can't help but laugh .  malicious certainly isn't the worst thriller of its kind out in the video racks ( a number of really fat turkies in this genre are out there ) , but it isn't all that good or original either .  feel free to treat this film maliciously , watch something else .

"  la confidential is a dandy piece of filmmaking that brings us back to the classic times of hollywood in the 50s .  organized crime was the biggest concern , corruption existed everywhere , and every cop had his own way of getting the job done .  there was " hollywood " jack vincennes ( kevin spacey ) who gets most of his information from the editor of a sleazy tell-all/show-all tabloid , sid hudgeons ( danny devito ) .  sporting dark sunglasses and a white sports coat , he isn't afraid to flash his tinseltown style .  detective bud white ( russell crowe ) has only a narrow-minded view of the law , and he uses excessive force to exact his unique kind of interrogation and brutal justice .  and then there is golden boy exley , wide-eyed and ambitious but extremely naive .  a horrible multiple murder begins to draw these three men together , each of whom become inexorably connected in their search for truth , action , and personal vindication .  almost immediately , an arrest is made .  but something doesn't seem quite right .  new developments become sinuous as the story begins to draw us deeper into the labyrinth of corruption and crime within the department .  suspicion and questions begin to mount .  odd alliances are created .  and as layers of the truth become revealed , the story grows more complex and intriguing by the moment .  when the mystery expands , we see other seemingly guilty characters enter the lives of these three cops , including a high-priced hooker ( kim basinger ) and a shady millionaire ( david strathairn ) .  all of the characters' levels of involvement are not immediately clear .  we watch with riveted fascination to learn more about why they are there and their stake in the case .  we sense a cross-pollination of clues that brings us , the audience , closer to the truth .  we hope that the three detectives can throw away their spite for one another and can pull their resources together in order to untangle the intricately created web of mystery .  absorbing and affecting , this movie has all the necessary ingredients to create a terrific gourmet serving of film noir .  it boasts mysterious figures in control , double-crosses , hard information from sleazy sources , dirty politicians , corrupt cops , haunting women , and hard-nosed cops experiencing moral ambiguity .  the underlying mystery is compelling .  the look and feel of the movie is gorgeous .  the entire cast is crisp and wonderful to watch ( i wouldn't be surprised if cromwell received an oscar nomination for his performance ) .  and , the dialogue is rich and memorable .  the best line of the movie is spoken when a key player dispenses advice to one of the detectives unsure of what to do .   " don't start trying to do the right thing , boy-o , " says he .   " you haven't had the practice .

neg@ pos neg the happy bastard's quick movie review  the concept of enjoying a stupid comedy is best realized as keeping it stupid , really .  shift gears even once and the audience can be thrown miserably out of control .  sadly , that is the case with kingpin , a film directed by the farrelly brothers , the duo that brought us there's something about mary and dumb and dumber .  since the duo directed and didn't write the script , i can assume that's part of the problem .  the story seems good enough : a pro bowler in the 1970's by the name of roy munson ( woody harrelson ) is sitting on top of the world .  his popularity has gone through the roof and he's getting his career off the ground .  then , however , he runs into ed mccracken ( bill murray ) , a rival bowler with hardly any real consideration for , well , anything .  these two form an ill-timed relationship that involves risky betting , and , before roy sees it coming , ed's abandoned him and he's about to lose his hand in a bowling ball machine .  forward seventeen years later , where roy has become quite the loser , complete with mechanical hand , torn-up car , and , of course , the occasional knocking up of the ugly-ass landlord to avoid paying rent for a while .  however , he finds a glimmer of a hope upon a visit to a local bowling alley , where he runs into an amish kid named ishmael ( randy quaid ) , who has quite the bowling arm .  with the kid's help , he figures he can be known again , particularly at the biggest bowling tournament rapidly approaching in reno , nevada .  of course , the amish kid needs some coaxing , particularly when you consider , well , he's amish .  this leads to some of the best comic scenes in the film , such as roy's process of removing horseshoes or milking the cow .  finally , the duo get on the road and , along the way , pick up an additional helper- a beautiful hustler ( played by the gorgeous vanessa angel ) .  the main problem i had with kingpin wasn't the fact it wasn't funny .  in fact , it does have some rather hilarious scenes in it , such as the aformentioned above and roy's explanation of not having children ( something involving a cheese grater ? ) .  but that's just it- scenes .  there's a couple of really serious scenes that throw off the entire momentum of the movie , like the abuse angel takes from her hustler ex-boyfriend .  i mean , was this really necessary ?  couldn't have this been handled just a bit wackier ?  i mean , this is a comedy , why throw ethics in ?  particularly in a farrelly brothers vehicle , where hair gel can be easily mistaken ?  that really ruined it , however , and that's too bad .  the acting is top notch , especially from angel and murray , and the really funny scenes are worth noting .  still , if you're going to think dumb , think dumb all the way through , ok ?  at least the farrelly brothers got back on track with mary or i'd still be a little bit irked . 
pos@ pos neg those of you who frequently read my reviews are not likely to be surprised by the fact that i have not read victor hugo's novel les miserables .  i don't know if a lot of people have , though i imagine many are familiar with the popular musical based on the novel .  i haven't even seen that .  going into this film , i had almost no knowledge of the story or its characters ( i even expected the film to be a musical ) .  walking away from it , i'm kind of glad i had no prior experience with the material .  writer/director bille august's film version is a straightforward , beautifully told film .  liam neeson stars as the miserable jean valjean ; in the beginning , he has just been released from a 19-year prison sentence .  he is allowed to stay in a convent by a kindly priest despite his rude and destructive behavior .  the priest's words of wisdom influence him , and he makes a vow to change himself .  nine years later , we are informed that he is now the mayor of a town called vigo ; nobody knows his real name , and that he is wanted for skipping his parole nine years ago .  conflicts arise when inspector javert ( geoffrey rush ) is assigned to vigo .  valjean remembers javert as one of the prison guards who constantly beat him , and javert remembers jean to be a convict .  javert is hell-bent on upholding the law , and he does everything in his power to bring jean to justice .  along the way , valjean meets and falls in love with a peasant woman , fantine ( uma thurman ) , and vows to take care of her daughter , cosette ( played later by claire danes ) .  les miserables is visually a solid and often striking picture .  the production design by anna asp is authentic and vast , and the sets don't look like sets ( they look like real towns and villages ) ; gabriella pescucci's costumes are noticeably spectacular .  basil poledouris' soundtrack is thick and usually well-placed ( though it does get a bit heavy at times ) .  many scenes in the film have a memorable photographic quality , such as the climax , which takes place next to a dark river in the grey obscurity of early evening .  augusts keeps the story simple ( which i hear is a good thing , since the novel is so complex ) and easy to follow .  he manages to develop the main characters and most of the subplots adequately .  i was also impressed that he didn't go overboard with flash and style , which is something so many directors seem to be doing to classic stories these days ( such as baz luhrmann's vicious tragedy william shakespeare's romeo + juliet ) .  this film feels solid and whole , and each scene has a certain amount of importance and vigor that keeps the audience interested .  liam neeson is terrific in the main role ; neeson is the kind of actor who does solemn desperation extremely well , and valjean is certainly a man who clearly fits that adjective .  thurman , in her small role , is very good , and proves that she has a lot of range and can perform in a very non-glamorous role such as this one .  rush is absolutely incredible as javert ; i don't remember ever feeling so strongly about a villain as i do here ; he adds depth and complexity with subtle glances and nuances , and effortlessly makes each of his scenes intense .  i can't be as charitable for danes , however ; though i know she is a talented actress , here she tends to overact when it might have been better to underplay the character a bit .  les miserables is , as i've said , a solid , intelligent motion picture .  my only complaint is that it feels a bit too easy , and perhaps too staged .  each scene is grand and huge , and exploding with poledouris' score , but i didn't always want them to be .  for the most part , les miserables is not a subtle or deep picture .  it's a good movie , and tells its story well , but august tends to hand-feed us themes and scenes that would have worked better had they been more subtle .  however , in a film this exciting and well-produced , a few minor flaws are easily overlooked . 
neg@ pos neg in french , the phrase " film noir " literally means " black film . "  webster defines it as " a type of crime film featuring cynical malevolent characters in a sleazy setting and an ominous atmosphere that is conveyed by shadowy photography and foreboding background music . "  classic film noir , including such memorable fare as " the big sleep , " the original " cape fear , " and orson welles' striking " a touch of evil , " employed black and white photography to emphasize the long shadows associated with the genre .  color came into play with neo-noir films like " chinatown " and " blade runner . "   " l . a . confidential , " easily the best film of 1997 , is a wonderful piece of contemporary neo-noir filmmaking .  for a textbook example of how to take all the elements of neo-noir and create an absolute mess , there's " palmetto . "  based on " just another sucker , " a short story written by british author rene raymond under the pseudonym james hadley chase , " palmetto " shows what happens when a filmmaker puts style ahead of substance .  director volker schlondorff ( " tin drum , " the handmaid's tale " ) stated " we weren't even sure for a long time if it was going to be a thriller or a comedy . "  it shows .   " palmetto " is too preposterous too be taken seriously as a thriller and too ponderous to work as a comedy .  the story begins when journalist harry barber ( woody harrelson ) is released from prison .  someone turned state's witness and revealed that harry was framed , a " reward " for blowing the lid on corruption in the small florida town of palmetto .  bitter and broke , harry plans to hitchhike to miami and start his life over , but ex-girlfriend nina ( gina gershon ) appears to return him to palmetto .  while hanging out at a bar , he notices that a beautiful woman has left her purse in a phone booth .  harry pockets her cash , only to have the woman reappear and catch him with her money in his pocket .  no problem , though .  the radiant blonde is rhea malroux ( elisabeth shue , ) the young wife of a very rich older man with heart problems , and she has a proposition for harry .  rhea needs " a threatening voice and someone to collect the ransom " for the staged kidnapping of her teenage stepdaughter odette ( chloe sevigny . )  the girls want to bilk a half-million dollar " ransom " from the old man and will happily give harry $50 , 000 for helping with the scam .  things go wrong , of course .  odette is found dead , leaving harry frantically trying to dispose of the corpse and cover his tracks .  in an ironic twist , harry is asked to work for the local d . a . 's  office .  they need a press liaison to field questions about odette's kidnapping and feel that harry is the perfect man for the job .  not a bad set-up for a noir film , if only schlondorff knew how to handle the material , but he never settles on a consistent tone .  the actors don't know what to do with their characters either , muddling the proceedings even further .  as if that wasn't enough , the story suffers from major problems in logic .  woody harrelson is a talented actor with an admirable willingness to take on risky parts , but he's lost here .  presented as a crusading journalist who was horribly wronged , it makes no sense that harry would be stupid and dishonest enough to get caught up in this scheme .  harrelson clearly doesn't know what to do with harry's character , so he spends most of the film glowering , sweating and generally acting miserable .  meanwhile , elisabeth shue gives a goofy performance , behaving like a vamp on nitrous oxide .  as the stepdaughter , chloe sevigny lays on so many slurpy quirks that she comes off like juliette lewis jr . despite a number of steamy scenes , there's no chemistry between harrelson and the women .  to make matters worse , schlondorff badly dubs in dialogue while the character's lips are running over each others bodies .  two particularly bad scenes highlight the film's problems .  while driving with a body in his trunk , harry has a minor car wreck and a cop shows up .  the officer wants to help change harry's flat tire and asks him to open the trunk .  harry's pathetic attempts to keep the trunk closed might have worked if played as comedy , but under schlondorff's grim direction , the scene is just embarrassing .  the film's nadir comes when a bad guy prepares to kill harry and nina .  we're supposed to be horrified watching our hero dangling over a bathtub filled with acid , but by this point the film has foundered so badly that the scene is merely reminiscent of when jessica and roger rabbit were suspended over a vat of dip .  had " palmetto " been played with tongue firmly in cheek , it might have been an entertaining shaggy dog story .  but under the harsh direction of schlondorff , the film is just a sluggish paint-by-numbers exercise in neo- noir cluelessness .  avoid this nonsense and go see " l . a . confidential " instead . 
pos@ pos neg after a rather disappointing " mary railly " , stephen frears is now officially back in business with a comeback worthy of praise .  this is one of the best surprises of this season -- a sweet , small budget comedy with a big heart .  in fact it's not even a comedy .  it's a drama or even more precise -- a clever satire on human relationships and needs .  based on a 1995 critically acclaimed novel by british author nick hornby , ``high fidelity'' is a wry and likable story about a man's quest for fulfillment and happiness .  rob gordon was a dj .  it seems that he could make everything spin -- except his own life .  now he owns championship vinyl , a little musical store , somewhere in new york .  when he suddenly gets dumped by his girlfriend , a gorgeous blond attorney , life suddenly looses every purpose .  decimated , humiliated and on the verge of a mental ( and emotional ) breakdown , he starts meditating over his life and the way it could have been -- about what's right and what's important .  he starts " categorizing " life , dividing it into " top 5 lists " .  and the most important is the " top 5 list " over the most painful breakups of his life , starting with 5th grade , when he found his young girlfriend with another boy .  though you might think that people change , grow more mature with age , it just doesn't seem that way and all rob's relationships were different versions of that first .  where did he go wrong ?  was it he that screwed up ?  or maybe life just stinks ?  while he is lost in his own self-pity , he must think of the " top 5 list " over his needs for the future , find the right elements and mix his life together .  with clever parallels to the cult of celebrity , music and with incredibly direct narration , it addresses the average audience member , in other words -- people like you and me .  although a lot of this honor should be addressed to the screenwriter ______ and frears , the director , the acting is equally important as the written word .  and here john cusack should absolutely be mentioned .  he is simply superb .  it is as much his movie as it is frears' .  the film would not be the same without him .  cusack -- whose character is sadder , wiser and 35 -- brings intelligence and warmth to post- mod irony .  most of his dialogue is delivered directly to the camera -- not an easy task -- but cusack pulls it off .  his interpretation feels so emotionally right , so incredibly realistic and precise that frears' message simply can't be ignored or overseen .  the other members of the cast do an equally remarkable job .  both ______ and jack black are fabulous .  even catherine zeta jones appears in a role where she actually acts , not just looks beautiful .  however , the most unexpected pleasant surprises is provided by todd louiso who delivers a spectacular comic performance as rob's co-worker and friend dick .  this is such an impressive achievement that it's almost worth a oscar-nomination .  he is simply a joy to behold .  otherwise , everyone are in their place , and at the right time -- all part of frears' colorful blend .  pretty much like edward norton's " keeping the faith " , this film doesn't follow any formula or belong to any genre -- it's dramatic , tragic , sarcastic , comic and even cynical , but never bitter or angry .  it's a little bit of everything , pretty much like life itself .  nothing seems unreal or staged .  it reflects reality as a mirror .  as you watch it , you go through the same emotional problems as the main character .  you feel and think and reflect .  this effect has become a rarity nowadays .  although it's primarily about the perils of love , ``high fidelity'' is secondarily about pop music .  rob owns championship vinyl and his employees , timid dick ( todd louiso ) and overbearing barry ( jack black ) , are fellow music snobs .  music is the language in their lives , the measure by which they define themselves and mark the significant events of their lives .  and so does the movie .  it is as much a musical film as anything else , as rob's journey is wonderfully portrayed through carefully inserted musical fragments .  in the end , you have gained something while watching it .  it's not the film of the century or even of the year .  it's not an special effects extravaganza .  it doesn't require big explosions or digital creatures to succeed .  it's a small movie about the big things .  and even though it does not contain heavy philosophy , you feel as if you have experienced something of significance , and you will experience that nice warm feeling for quite some time . 
neg@ pos neg one night , during a torrential downpour that flooded the streets , we went to see -- what else -- hard rain .   " so , are we all going to die ? "  the sheriff ( randy quaid ) asks in the story's opening line as he evacuates his flooded town .  the answer is pretty much yes , but not nearly soon enough .  and to add insult to injury , the supposedly dead , regretfully , often turn out not to be so .  populating this bad tv-movie-of-the-week material are a host of talented actors .  one can only hope they were rewarded handsomely for acting in this hopelessly muddled picture .  besides the obvious hardships of acting most scenes while dog paddling in the water , they will all receive black marks on their records for appearing in this dismal movie .  graham yost's script serves up one cliche after another for the actors , who thankfully managed to mumble quite a few of the lines .  director mikael salomon's staging is so confusing that you may have trouble figuring out what is happening .  the befuddled presentation is exacerbated by peter menzies , jr . 's dark and ugly cinematography .  the plot concerns an armored car that gets stuck in the raging water .  onboard are guards tom and his uncle charlie .  christian slater , who is much better in his tender roles as in untamed heart , plays tom .  edward asner drops by briefly to take on the role of the soon to be dead charlie .  coming to their " rescue " is a gang headed by jim , played on autopilot by the great actor morgan freeman .  he views the loot , three million dollars worth , as his retirement plan .  the entire movie is one big watery chase with the sheriff and his posse tracking jim and his gang , who are in turn after tom .  along the way , tom picks up a love interest in the person of a crucifix-weapon wielding woman named karen , played in a totally wasted performance by minnie driver .  the action sequences are repetitive and without much interest .  they do feature lots of explosions and gunfire to keep you awake .  christopher young's emotionless score for the film has a single trait , ear-shattering loudness .  the plot holes are as big as the ones in the dam that breaks , submerging the town .  the characters have an infinite number of bullets and rarely do they have to bother reloading their guns .  the weapons and the ammunition spend most of the time under water or being rained on but always fire perfectly .  when one of the bad guys drops a gun into the water , it stays in the same place until much later when tom swims to get it , even though the swift water is so strong it is uprooting large trees .  counting these improbabilities is one of the more enjoyable ways to spend your time as you wait for the characters to kill each other .  the show has a single , but unprintable , good line .  betty white plays an incessantly bossy wife , and , when her hen-pecked husband finally told her off , our audience roared with laughter .  the show concludes with a sickening set of twists .  the best that can be said of the picture is that it is merely stupefyingly awful as opposed to laughably bad .  hard rain runs 1 : 37 .  it is rated r for violence and would be fine for teenagers .   ( the two families behind us shockingly had a half-dozen preschoolers among them . ) 
pos@ pos neg  " well this is not mission : difficult , mr . hunt , it's mission : impossible .  difficult should be a walk in the park for you . "  ---agent swanbeck ( sir anthony hopkins ) , the series' new agent phelps , takes ethan hunt ( tom cruise ) down a notch .  a russian scientist ( rade serbedzija ) has created a new virus ( and its antidote ) called chimera that destroys its host within twenty hours of injection .  a rogue imf agent , sean ambrose ( dougray scott ) , wants to use the disease and cure to blackmail a pharmaceutical company into selling him enough stock to make him owner of the company ( he knows it will soon be worth its weight in gold thanks to the outbreak of the virus he is going to cause ) .  posing as ethan hunt , ambrose gains the confidence of the scientist long enough to get only the cure , not realizing that the scientist had injected himself with the virus to prevent exactly what ambrose was trying to do .  the real ethan hunt is called in from his vacation to persuade beautiful thief nyah nordoff-hall ( thandie newton ) to assist the imf team in retrieving the stolen goods .  ethan and nyah fall quickly in love , but ethan soon finds himself in a real dilemma when he learns that his new love has only been hired because she was a former lover of ambrose's .  reluctantly , he sets up nyah to be rescued from prison by ambrose so she can infiltrate his compound and send back intelligence to the team .  ethan must race against time to keep ambrose from obtaining and spreading the virus and prevent any harm from coming to nyah .  although the first mission : impossible film was a moderate box office success , audiences panned it because they felt the plot was too confusing and there wasn't much action ( although being a fan of the series both old and new , i thought the movie was pretty decent and especially gutsy to make phelps a bad guy ) .  that problem has been rectified in the sequel by making the plot more accessible ( courtesy of one of the writers of the previous entry , robert towne ) and by turning the film into one gigantic action set piece under the steady hand of action film guru john woo .  the end result is one of the most entertaining ( yet simple ) action films made in a long while .  unfortunately , the first forty minutes or so are relatively slow , dwelling mainly on ethan and nyah's quickly blossoming romance and seeming more in place in a james bond film than with the less glamorous mission : impossible tv series .  ethan's conflict is a compelling one , but it seems very rushed ( and comes about because of a near fatal car wreck that ethan himself causes ! ) .  john woo handles all of this with an artistic flair that seems out of place , featuring a great deal of slow fades and dramatically framed close-ups .  the surreal nature of these sequences are distracting and ultimately a detriment to the film .  thankfully though , at the point ambrose discovers nyah's deception , mission : impossible ii becomes very entertaining and action-packed .  robert towne's screenplay takes some of the conventions set up in the first film and parodies them during a sequence where ethan must break into a high-rise building and retrieve the remaining specimens of the virus .  after that , the action scenes just begin to build in intensity , as is the case with many of woo's previous high-octane films .  the final half hour is an all out assault of action ( a good deal of which is ruined by the trailer , unfortunately ) .  as far as summer entertainment goes , mission : impossible ii is serviceable fare .  anyone looking for hardcore action won't be disappointed ( except for during the first half of the film , perhaps ) .  even if you weren't a fan of the first film , this entry deserves some checking out .

( he looks the same in both of his roles-- an incredible fact that's missed by everyone in the story ! )  the very british supporting cast-- including michael gambon and george cole-- gives credibility to the smaller parts .  glenn close also appears as a madam that the good doctor calls upon .  her performance is as close to intentional camp as the movie ever gets and-- as a bonus-- offers a likely peek at her upcoming cruella de ville in the live-action 101 dalmantions .  the biggest botch in mary reilly is suspense : there is none .  no terror , no tension ; nothing .  without any weight , wit , or wonder to propel the story , the viewer is left with little more to do than pay attention to the period detail , a few buckets of blood , and stuart craig's fabulously dreary production design .  all of which gets old after about an hour , at which point i recommend leaving .

pos@ pos neg the happy bastard's 30-second review  big daddy  happy gilmore as a father ?  of course !  that's the latest scenario presented by adam sandler in the new movie big daddy , a movie that's passable but isn't really considered some of sandler's best work .  he doesn't actually play happy gilmore in the movie , but a variation of him .  he's sonny coufax , a man who's living off a settlement he got for a cab running over his foot and his one-day-a-week gig as a tollbooth man ( tollbooth willie ? ) .  his girlfriend ( kristy swanson ) is fed up with his lifestyle and demands a change before she leaves him .  enter a 5-year old kid , who's mysteriously dropped at his doorstep and intended for his preppy roommate ( jon stewart ) , who's off in china on a business trip .  from there , coufax basically acts as the kid's father , teaching him different things like peeing on the side of a building and tripping up skateboarders with sticks .  he even manages to use the kid in a sort of con game to get the attention of a beautiful law office worker ( joey lauren adams ) , but , somehow , he also garners the attention of social services , who aren't particularly pleased with coufax's actions , as he pretends to be his roommate to keep the kid .  the reason i say it's not really sandler's best work is because it gets really sappy towards the end of a movie , showing some odd feelings that somehow didn't really belong in a sandler vehicle .  i mean , it fits the movie's tone and everything , and sandler handles it well , but it's just oddly placed , that's all .  fortunately , it doesn't destroy the goofy glee path it's been following and it still makes you feel good .  sandler does a good job here , as he does in most of his movies .  rob schneider , however , is irritating as his friend , an immigrant delivery boy who can't read .  stewart , in his minor time on screen , is great , and adams remains a joy to watch .  look for steve buscemi as well as a homeless bum .  he's a hoot .  directed by dennis dugan ( director of happy gilmore ) , the movie remains a good couple of hours to pass the time with .  again , there are faults , but , hey , everyone needs to get emotional sometimes . 
neg@ pos neg my giant is two movies for the price of one , but neither is worth the cost of admission , even if you get in free .  as lamely directed by michael lehmann , the picture tries to be a comedy by using and reusing every giant joke in the book .   ( " without goliath , david is just some punk throwing rocks . " )  languidly paced throughout , the movie becomes increasingly lugubrious as the screenplay by david seltzer ( the omen ) meanders toward its sad ending .  since it's rarely funny or convincingly dramatic , what the filmmakers thought they were doing remains a mystery .  other than a few nice visuals , there's nothing to recommend the picture .  with great film comedies under his belt from when harry met sally ? to the original city slickers , billy crystal has shown that he's more than the world's best oscar host .  he does , however , have a propensity for choosing hopeless material as in last year's father's day and this year's my giant .  one wonders if he reads the script before agreeing to go ahead with a project .  surely reading the one for my giant would have shown that there was nothing there .  perhaps he thought he could ad lib it into success .  or maybe he wants to be a dramatic actor and thought he could do something serious with the movie's somber tone .  the most charitable thing that could be said about it is that it is so ineffectual that people will probably forget they saw it by the next day .  this one-joke movie's single idea is to place real-life basketball player gheorghe muresan , who stands seven and a half feet tall , into as many visually striking situations as possible .  sammy ( crystal ) , an agent currently without clients , is rescued after a car accident by a sweet romanian giant named max ( muresan ) .  after throwing out constant one-liners ( " either god is in the salvage business or big foot just took my car . " ) ,  sammy decides to get serious , seeing max as his meal ticket .  and although he doesn't like it , he's willing to sign max up to do disgusting events like a wrestling match with a half-dozen dwarfs .   ( the movie itself knows no bounds as it contains one of the most putrid and lengthy vomiting scenes ever . )  after a series of missed opportunities , the comedic part of the movie is over , and it turns into a cheap and maudlin disease movie .  we learn that max's condition is terminal , and he will soon die .  to be fair , the movie does contain a few good scenes - all of which you can see in the trailers .  let's hope billy gets himself a pair of reading glasses before he signs up for another movie .  my giant runs too long even at just 1 : 37 .  it is rated pg for violence and profanity and would be acceptable for kids around ten and up .  my son jeffrey and his friend matthew , both 9 , gave the movie a single star and had nothing good to say about it .  matthew pointed out that it " is not as good as it could have been or should have been . "   ( amen . )  he went on to comment that he did not like the way the movie changed completely in the middle .  jeffrey complained particularly about how gross the movie was . 
pos@ pos neg it's tough to really say something nice about a type of person who's so ethnocentric that any humanity they once had is now gone , but by god , " american history x " does it , and for that , i commend it .  it not only takes balls but intelligence to make a human being out of a neo-nazi skinhead , a kind of person who dedicates their lives to hating anyone who's not what they are , and this film wisely and miracurously pulls it off .  the subject of this film is one of them , but he is worse than one of the blind followers that make up most skinhead members since he is the leader of the pack .  he's the one who instigates them to take a firm grip onto their rage , and then in another brilliant stroke , justifies it with political propoganda that makes eerie sense when he speaks .  he's so utterly convincing as a public speaker and so firm in his convictions that it comes as a shock when he actually goes through the rehabilitation process .  his name is derek vinyard , and he's played by edward norton with so much fire and intensity that when he speaks he's almost as convincing and arresting a public speaker as , say , malcom x . when we first see him , he's clean shaven , with a jet black swastica emrboidered on his left breast , a devlish goatee , and he's attacking the black carjackers outside of his house dressed in nothing but his white boxers and carrying a handgun in his hand that never seems to run out of bullets , at least when he doesn't need them .  he so believes in his convictions that he's willing to put his beliefs to the test , even if he knows it will mean a stop in prison , if only for a couple years .   " american history x " is about derek , how he became a neo-nazi skinhead , how he rose to power , how he was rehabilitated in prison after murdering two black men in a fit of rage that was less to do with the stealing of his car and more to do with proving himself , and how he tried to save others , namely his younger brother , from making the same mistake .  we see him at all of these stages - as a smart teenager , a vicious hate monger , a man having an epiphany , and the man who tries to correct what he's done before - and in all of these , we get a portrait of a man from all sides .  or at least , that's the intention .  the film's framing device is his brother , danny ( edward furlong , perpetually looking about 13 ) , also now a skinhead , and how his principal , bob sweeney ( avery brooks , who i just found out was or is the captain on star trek's deep space 9 ) , is trying to " correct " him .  when the film opens , danny has just written a book report on " mein kampf , " landing him in trouble with sweeney , which causes him to make him write a paper on derek's life and how it has gotten him nowhere .  coincidentally , this day is the day derek is released from prison , and when we see him , he's cleaned-up , not as buff , and has a full head of hair .  he's just as intelligent , but still very rough along the edges , but he's wisened up .  he's no longer controlled by his anger at blacks and jews , and tries to persuade danny , who's becoming what derek was before , to give up his lifestyle .  but danny won't .  he goes to a large skinhead beer bash , meets with the skinhead leader ( stacy keach ) , and then discovers that derek is as opposed to neo-nazi-dom as he was for it a couple of years ago .  the film circles around this , then spins off into non-linear flashbacks , all done in black and white .  we mostly see derek at his prime as a skinhead , living in venice beach , organizing vicious and quasi-sadistic raids on local stores that no longer hire the white , middle-class teenagers since they can easily get cheaper illegal immigrants to do the same work , and mouthing off his theories on affirmative action and how illegal immigrants and blacks have destroyed the fundamentals this country was built on .  to them , the white man is the one who has gotten the fuzzy end of the lolipop , and he not only speaks elloquently , forcefully , and intelligently , but he backs everything up with political reasons , justifying their rage at least to them .  and frighteningly enough , much of what he says sounds true .   " american history x " is a collection of really great scenes and moments , rather than a cohesive , great film that flows effortlessly from one moment to the next .  in it , there are some of the best scenes i've seen all year .  one scene features a dinner between derek's family , and his mother's newest boyfriend ( played with reserve by eliott gould ) , a jewish liberal who quietly disagrees with derek's rightist views , launching the scene into a fit of rage and anger that builds unparalled emotions in the audience ( gould's reaction to derek's final summation is unnerrving ) .  another scene uses humor and traditional macho sex talk to build a friendship and a nice connection between derek and a black co-worker ( guy torry ) while folding laundry in prison .  and another soon-to-be-classic is actually divided in two : the murder of the two black men that winds derek in jail , which contains a final murder so nasty that it may be the most revoltingly shocking all year .  there's much more to appreciate , like the acting , which is uniformly good , with stand-outs coming from avery brooks , beverly d'angelo ( as the long-suffering mother ) , and gould ( who has one horrible line , but other than that , comes off with the best performance he's given in what seems like a really long time ) .  norton walks off with the film , though , coming off with such intensity that he reduces anyone not doing an adequate job to rubble .  in only the fifth movie of his career , norton has invented himself as one of the most reliable and intense actors of his generation , and maybe the best .  there's nothing like it when norton really gets rolling in this movie , spewing out lines with such authority that he commands all attention from the audience , coming off with power similar to that of a young maron brando .  that he allows the little emotions to seep through is amazing .  sadly enough , this isn't going to be the great portrait of racism that it perhaps hopes to be .  it's too unambitious and even a little contrived to really take off as either a powerful statement or an emotional masterpiece .  the ending , especially , is pencilled in from other movies , tossed in just so the emotional keyboard can be trounced upon .  some of the skinheads are reduced to mere cliches ( kevin smith regular ethan suplee fairs rather annoyingly as the " fat skinhead , " whose lines consist without fail of expressing his desire to eat more ) , and even the dramatic arc isn't as well travelled .  furlong's danny never seems to really be learning a lesson , since the flashbacks refuse to show his point of view , and when he decides to make a change by the end ( which was inevitable ) , it doesn't seem like it has actually arrived there .  even derek's descent into skinhead-dom doesn't seem justified .  though his fireman father ( william russ , the dad from " boy meets world , " and don't ask me how i know that ) is killed by a black junkie , and even before he spoke against affirmative action intelligently , there never seems to be any real back story why derek became so intense about his beliefs .  as such , one can see why the director , tony kaye , wanted to have his name removed .  sorta .   " american history x " is a very good movie , and i was very moved by it , but it could be a lot better , and the problem seems to be that the cut as it is is not up to what he claims to be his potential .  somewhere , he claims , there lies a tony kaye cut , and that was to be the true cut until it was viewed by norton , who then ordered another cut , and that is thus .  although he aimed for the directing credit to go to " alan smithee , " the resident name for any film that is to be disowned by its director , it wasn't allowed to him , under the grounds that once you disown a film , you can not badmouth it ( but really , that's the macguffin - no one really wanted a film this good to be given the alan smithee sign of disapproval ) .  kaye's right in that it's not up to par , even if he's not referring to normal par but rather his own personal par .  this will not be a " do the right thing " for the late 90s .  yet it still gets its point across intelligently , and backs it up with its story ( its message , that one cannot be so enwrapped in one's own beliefs or pain and suffering will occur , is literally said over the narration , unfortunately ) .  and even if it isn't perfect , at least when avery brooks turns to norton after he has been beaten and raped in prison , and asks him if anything he's done has made his life any better , it realy hits a nerve , not only in derek , but also in the audience . 
neg@ pos neg there's a scene early on in " jawbreaker " where a character utters the unintentionally prophetic line , " that is * so * not funny " .  how right she was .  this pathetic tale of three high-schoolers who accidentally kill their best friend in a birthday kidnapping prank gone horribly awry is never even remotely funny .  or fun .  or original .  not content with the too-obvious " heathers " heisting , the filmmakers proceed to lift freely from a staggering variety of sources , including " carrie " , " bride of frankenstein " , " blue velvet " , and even shaw's pygmalion , itself recently remade as " she's all that " .   " jawbreaker " is a pastiche , and not even an enjoyable one .  i find it extremely telling that the most engaging part of the film is the credit sequence , a jawbreaker factory montage inexplicably backed by veruca salt's " volcano girls " ; serving as a blueprint for the rest of the film , the song has absolutely nothing to do with the footage we're watching .  just close your eyes and pretend you're listening to an alt-rock station ; you won't be missing anything .  the blame for a mess this big has to be spread around among the principals .  rebecca gayheart , following roles in " scream 2 " and " urban legend " , should have known better than to take yet another role in yet another teen body count movie .  pam grier has totally wasted any credibility she might have gotten from her role in quentin tarantino's " jackie brown " .  and rose mcgowan should just quit acting .  she has no charisma , no presence , and no acting skills other than rolling her eyes and looking disaffected .  mcgowan manages to be upstaged by her real-life boyfriend , rocker marilyn manson , whose fifteen second role here is far more interesting than anything any of the " real " actors are doing .  manson , sans trademark makeup & contact lenses , and with an obviously fake moustache , looks eerily like nicholas cage ; who woulda thunk it ?  that crack about direction by committee wasn't merely a pithy sound-bite .  stylistically , thematically & narratively , " jawbreaker " is all over the map , varying wildly in tone & content from scene to scene .  though credited solely to writer/director darren stein , one gets the feeling that no two scenes here were actually guided by the same hands .  if stein was indeed responsible for the whole of this atrocity , someone needs to get the man some drugs , pronto .  prozac , lithium , kava , ritalin , something , anything .  he's quite obviously in desperate need of chemical help .   " jawbreaker " is a monumental waste of effort and resources , and quite likely one of the single worst films i've ever seen .  to call " jawbreaker " garbage would be to insult garbage .  bad flicks for the rest of the year are safe ; i've already got my pick for worst film of '99 .   " jawbreaker " runs approximately 90 minutes , though it feels longer than " titanic " , and is rated r for language , sexual situations and graphic violence .  not recommended for kids , teens , or anyone else . 
pos@ pos neg kadosh means sacred in hebrew .  amos gitai's fictional work , after spending most of his career doing documentaries , is a grim story about a failed hasidic marriage , even though the marriage is a loving one .  the marriage will symbolize the clash of cultures in modern israel between the native israeli's modern viewpoint toward religion and the political savvy hasidic's intolerable one , as both groups are vying for control of the secular government .  gitai ( devarim/yom yom ) is a labor party leftist , who believes that if the rigid hasidic ever got control of the government , it would sound the death knell of israel .  the emphasis of the film is on how the ultra-orthodox jews of that sect live by the letter of the torah in everything they do and how they subjugate the women to accept their vision of god's law from only the male's view .  that if they ever got control of the country , their intolerant attitude would subjugate the country the same way the women are .  the story takes place in jerusalem's jewish quarters called mea shearim , where we are taken down sinewy back streets with placards pasted on the walls , and into the crowded apartments and prayer rooms where the protagonists live out their idea of the proper jewish life , which is much different than the way most jews live in israel .  this is a controversial film , in that the women are unhappy and the male attitudes are to such an extreme patriarchal ones , that the film is bound to anger most viewers , no matter their belief .  it is a slow-moving , meticulous film , that grabs hold of you by the collar and never lets go .  the force of what is seen , though filmed in an objective manner , never taking a cheap shot at the hasidim , is nevertheless bound to leave questions about the nature of such a practice of strict observance .  the film is meant to be critical of such a rigid people , as it implies how they kill the spirit of everything they touch and with their extreme phobic attitudes , it makes it impossible for them to unite the country when they can't at present live in harmony with their own people , and it would be even more impossible to imagine them living with their arab neighbors in peace .  the film opens as meir rises at dawn and goes through his prayer ritual , where every prayer is made to the virtues of god .  he even thanks god that he didn't make him a woman .  his wife rivka accepts the fate she was born into and looks at him from the next bed where she sleeps separately according to hasidic custom .  she looks at him with glistening eyes , not questioning the laws or rebelling against her secondary role and how her religion keeps her from studying the talmud and having all the modern conveniences of life , and from seeing movies and tv .  meir is a talmudic scholar .  his father ( abu warda ) is a rabbi at the yeshiva .  he has been married for ten years and his wife has not been able to give him a child .  since the hasidim look upon a woman's role in life being only to conceive children , and cook and clean house for the man , while the man's role is to spend his time in prayer , therefore there is an insurmountable problem in this otherwise loving marriage .  she receives an anonymous letter that states " a woman without a child is no better than dead . "  meir's response , is that it is written like that in the talmud .  meir's father tells him that the marriage contract must be broken : " a man who dies without progeny rips a page from the torah . "  all the blame is placed on rivka , who is thought of as unpure as the reason for her being barren .  she will go through countless ritual baths to cleanse herself , as her rigid mother ( koenig ) dunks her in the holy water and says a ritual prayer for the 12 times she is dunked as an homage to the 12 tribes of israel .  their religion doesn't permit them to be examined extensively by a doctor .  rivka goes on the sly and finds out that it is her husband who is sterile , but she cannot tell him that because of their religion .  so when meir's father chooses a younger woman for his son , she is exiled to live alone in a cold apartment in the same jewish quarters .  rivka's spirited younger sister malka does not want to get married but wants to live a more liberated life .  she has a long time romantic relationship with a fellow hasidic yaakov .  but , because of the way they were both raised , she is still a virgin .  when yaakov joined the israeli army to fight in lebanon , something his sect is not allowed to do , he is thereby banished from the sect even though he is still a believer .  he now works as a singer in a nightclub .  malka's mother is worried that her daughter won't get married , so she arranges with the rabbi for her to marry yossef , someone whom she doesn't love .  yossef is a very stern follower of the order , he is also a political activist who drives around the city in a sound-truck with a bull-horn urging jews to stick together and fight their godless enemies .  the two sisters are close and languidly discuss their options , with rivka telling her sister to accept the marriage , it will make her happy ; but , while malka is reluctantly forced into accepting it , she has other plans to ruin this bogus marriage .  the harshest scene in the film is on malka's wedding night .  yossef prays to god for a child and then robotically gets malka to spread her legs , and without the least bit of affection , only a nervousness shown on his part for the function he supplies , as he goes inside her and rams her hard , thrusting away until the act is completed and then retiring without a word or gesture of love .  the sisters have choices , like everyone else in life does .  but the choices are obliterated by one's beliefs , circumstances , and inward nature , and how difficult it is to carry out those choices if it goes completely against the way one is brought up .  for the sisters , the choices are life or death ones .  gitai by closing in on the daily rituals , tight living quarters and close-knit community , has shown how difficult these choices are for those who have never seen another world and have been kept in the dark all their life .  the film ends with the forlorn malka walking atop of jerusalem and looking down upon it as an outsider would , and everything seems strange to her , all the things she once thought of as being set in stone are now harsh memories , as she has made her choice , and the price of that choice is very heavy indeed . 
neg@ pos neg  " battlefield earth " is the best comedy of the year .  it has to be .  the other prospect is just too horrifying to consider .  bad movie syndrome struck me again , so after witnessing how much " battlefield earth " has been proclaimed a train wreck in both critical and popular circles , i felt the masochistic urge to see the disaster first-hand .  is it as bad as advertised ?  oh yes , very much so .  the plot is incomprehensible .  the acting is atrocious .  the special effects are mediocre .  the action is dull .  the implausibilities are legion .  the dialogue is cringe-inducing .  the whole package is funny when it wants to be serious and irritating when it wants to be funny .  i don't even want to continue reviewing this movie ; i'd like to purge the atrocity from my mind as soon as possible , but you probably want to read my thrashing in all its sarcastic glory , so here it is :  the premise is basically a rip-off of " planet of the apes , " only minus the apes and philosophical discussion , and plus a race of evil aliens from the planet psychlo .  the year is 3000 , the psychlos have conquered earth , and the human population has been enslaved .  only a handful of humans escaped to radiation-rich areas to escape the aliens ; they live out their lives in fear .  one man , johnny goodboy ( i know , i know ) tyler ( barry pepper ) , ventures to the outworld and is captured by the psychlos .  there he confronts the psychlo head of security : a big , ugly , klingon-looking creature called terl ( john travolta ) .  pressed into slavery , johnny vows to lead a revolution and take the planet back .  meanwhile , terl is faced with his own problems : he has recently learned that he's stuck living on earth ( which he hates ) for the rest of his career because he pissed off his boss by sleeping with the big man's daughter .  he decides to give johnny knowledge of the psychlo language and technology ( this is where the plot gets ridiculous .   .   . )  so the " man-animal " can lead a mining expedition into places the psychlos can't go .  terl then plans to keep the mined gold for himself .  of course , his plan doesn't work .  so many things wrong with this movie -- where to begin ?  how about with travolta , whose hollywood clout brought about this , the cinematic version of scientology guru l . ron hubbard's sci-fi novel ?  early previews for " battlefield earth , " with constant shots of a makeup-laden travolta cackling like lex luthor , had me ( and several audience members ) remarking , " what the hell is travolta thinking ? "  the movie did nothing to stem such remarks .  all that ridiculous cackling he did in the trailers is in full force here : terl cackles after nearly every line , and so does every other psychlo .  of course , this makes every scene hilariously overwrought , no more so than when the script clumsily stumbles into political commentary .  the psychlos are probably supposed to be some kind of satire of corporate america , but ceos generally don't laugh maniacally after denying pay raises to their employees .   ( " you were going to be promoted -- but now you're not !  fwahahahahahahahaha ! ! ! ! ! " )  it's no big surprise terl loses to the humans -- he's an idiot .  he breaks every kind of supervillain rule in the book .  he underestimates his enemies , assuming he'll win just because he's smarter .   ( he uses the word " leverage " like some sort of scientologist mantra . )  not content to go the james bond villain route of explaining his plans to the hero , he hooks him up to a machine that gives him knowledge of all the psychlos' language and technology .   ( why this machine is even around in the first place is beyond me . )  he then appears shocked that johnny points a gun at him .  no wonder this guy never got his promotion .  the plot inconsistencies are too numerous to mention .  why do the psychlos build an earth base in which both they and the human slaves must wear little breathing apparatuses to survive ?  how come the psychlos are wasting their time mining for gold when the doors of fort knox are wide open ?  how in the world did all those fighter jets survive sitting in a hangar for 1 , 000 years ?  and how do all these previously brain-dead cavemen learn to fly them so quickly ?  there's a whole lot more to scratch one's head about in " battlefield earth . "  bring a scorecard to track the plot holes .  director roger christian shoots " battlefield earth " in the most distracting way possible , tilting nearly every shot sideways for no discernible reason .  all the characters appear to be standing on the walls , and it's awfully difficult to watch a movie when you must tilt your head just to watch ordinary passages of dialogue .  the action sequences are atrociously edited , every one turned into an endless slow-motion parade that drains all potential excitement .  are these things really so hard to construct ?  my respect for supposed " lightweight " action directors has grown by leaps and bounds after witnessing in " battlefield earth " how badly an action sequence can be shot .  this movie is an absolute headache .  it's not just the shot selection and editing ; the movie , quite frankly , makes no sense .  for most of " battlefield earth's " running time , i just didn't know what was happening .  it didn't have anything to do with me finding the events stupid or illogical ( though they certainly are ) -- i really had no idea what the hell was going on .  when i pieced the plot together later , it didn't look any better .  here's how much of a disaster this is : " battlefield earth " is already the worst movie of the year , and it's going to take something really , really inept to top it .  the only thing we can take comfort in about the film is that no one will be suckered into joining the church of scientology because of it .  in fact , i'd think that hubbard's cult would want to distance themselves from this bomb as fast as possible .  that'll teach me to give into bad movie syndrome again . 
pos@ pos neg wild things is a suspenseful thriller starring matt dillon , denise richards , and neve campbell that deals with all the issues ; sex , love , murder , and betrayal .  the setting of the film is a town named blue bay .  it consists of many swamps and slums and , on the other hand , rich estates owned by the town's different benefactors .  the film opens just before the beginning of a senior seminar at the town's ritzy , expensive high school .  it is here that we meet all of the core characters .  there's guidance counselor sam lombardo , police officers ray duquette and gloria perez , dark mysterious senior suzie toller , and the popular head cheerleader kelly van ryan .  we first see that all of the senior girls are smitten with the handsome guidance counselor , but none more than kelly .  throughout the first portion of the film we see how far kelly will go to get sam until she accuses him of rape .  shortly after , suzie , too , confesses that sam raped her as well .  this pushes kelly's sex craving mother , sandra , to stop at nothing until sam is convicted .  during the trial , kelly gives a teary confession of how sam raped her .  however , it is later revealed by suzie that sam never raped either of the girls , it was all a vengeful plan against the guidance counselor .  after sam is cleared , kelly's mother pays sam a very substantial amount of cash in order for him not to sue her .  it is then revealed that sam , kelly , and suzie were all in on it together .  it is here that the film starts to reveal just who is being honest with each other and who has their own hidden agenda .  matt dillon stars as sam lombardo .  sam is the kind of guy that every woman would like to sink their claws into , and sam obviously knows it and uses it to his own advantage .  he isn't the obvious best of actors , but dillon does give a convincing performance .  however , his talents seem to be rendered useless near the end of the film , making it look as though his character has lost all of his ethics and principles , although he never had many to start out with in the first place .  neve campbell , who most people relate to scream and scream 2 , plays blue bay outcast suzie toller .  suzie obviously has some serious issues to deal with which are obvious from her first scene in the film .  campbell is very successful with this character , adding the slightest bit of charm to a seemingly repulsive character and making her fun to watch .  playing kelly van ryan is denise richards .  kelly is your typical , rich , sexy , head cheerleader who thinks she can have any man she choses , like her sexpot mother sandra .  one of the most interesting things about this film is how it compares and contrasts the relationship between kelly and her mother .  denise richards , still hot off the press from starship troopers , gives the most interesting performance in the entire film .  in the beginning , kelly looks to be a paper thin character , but richards adds a little more spice and ultimately makes the character not only sexy , but dominating as well .  kevin bacon gives one of his fair performances as ray duquette .  this character looks to be one of the most boring , predictable in the film .  however , it is a relationship revealed between him and suzie that adds depth to his story .  still , the film doesn't seem to gain much from bacon's performance , only his name .  in the supporting cast , theresa russell plays the much oversexed sandra van ryan , daphne rubin-vega gives an unappealing performance as cop gloria perez , and bill murray shines as sam's lawyer , ken bowden .  hats off to murray for adding the perfect touch of comedy to the film .  although wild things was displayed by the press as being an erotic thriller , the eroticism , which is portrayed with good taste , is kept to a minimum and focuses more on the plot and the relationships between the characters .  this is truly a very good film worth seeing if your looking for a movie with a thick plot filled with it's share of twists .

"  the result is a mix of genres that don't mesh well .  elements of the ritz brothers-style comedy ( for those few who remember that comedic troupe from the 1939 " the three musketeers " ) , the man with no name from " a fistful of dollars " ( d'artagnan demands that the bad guys apologize to his horse in a direct ref to the clint eastwood spaghetti western ) and hong kong action choreography are all utilized in the original script by gene quintano .  the result is an action flick that bears little resemblance to its source material while it makes contemporary that material in an effort to grab the " matrix " crowd .  alexandre dumas may well be rolling in his grave if he knows what was done to his classic oeuvre and characters .  the real problem with the " the musketeer " lies in the casting of the two lead , romantically intertwined characters , d'artagnan and francesca ( mena suvari ) .  chambers has the boyishly handsome good looks for the character , a la chris o'donnell , but lacks any onscreen charisma .  suvari has the doe-eyed , pretty looks as the chambermaid who has the ear of the queen , but she , too , does not have the chemistry to command the screen .  if " the musketeer " makes them any money , they should invest in acting lessons .  stronger performers may have helped to raise the bar on this one .  the supporting cast is , on the surface , impressive .  catherine denueve plays the queen of france and lends her character an air of royalty , dignity and humor , especially when she plays off of d'artagnan's mentor , planchet ( jean-pierre castaldi , who reminds of andre the giant in " the princess bride ) .  stephen rea looks good in the part of the conniving usurper cardinal richelieu , but is given very little to help flesh out his character .  tim roth is the kind of bad guy you love to hate as the cardinal's chief henchman , febre .  he is so bad he makes simon legree look like a boy scout .  the rest of the players , particularly the three musketeers aramis ( nick moran , " lock , stock and two smoking barrels " ) , porthos ( steve spiers ) and athos ( jan gregor kremp ) , are background fodder whose role is to come to d'artagnan's aid when needed .  peter hyam's does double duty as director and cinematography and may be too stretched to do both well .  a stronger hand at the helm could have helped the mediocre performances of the leads and better utilized his veteran thesps .  photography is straightforward action fare that goes through all the appropriate action flick motions - d'artagnan takes on a tavern full of thugs and bests them single-handed ; he fights a gang of febre's henchmen aboard a speeding coach to protect the queen ( with the obligatory branches hanging over the road ) ; he goes one on one with his lifelong enemy , febre , who murdered d'artagnan's folks years before .  it is all routine stuff .  the renowned wire work developed by the hong kong action masters is used to artificial effect as the players leap , defying gravity , up walls and from horse to horse .  it works in a sci-fi film like " the matrix " or in a classical fantasy like " crouching tiger , hidden dragon " but just calls attention to itself in " the musketeer . "  at one point i could swear i saw the stunt wire being used .  it did not make me a believer and i am very disappointed .  with a run time of 106 minutes it should have been more like 80 and i give it a d . 
pos@ pos neg billy bob thornton , who had a sudden rise to fame with 1996's sling blade after spending years as a virtually unknown actor and writer , is becoming one of the most versatile - and most accomplished - american actors around at the moment .  as jacob , the simple but at times very bright loser brother of bill paxton's hank , thornton gives a performance which should leave an indelible mark on all but the most hardened viewers .  three men , hank ( paxton ) , jacob ( thornton ) and their friend lou ( brent briscoe ) stumble upon a plane wreck which , upon closer inspection , yields a rotting corpse and a bag full of money .  jacob and lou want to pocket the cash .  hank , the smarter - and perhaps more naive - of the three , insists on leaving the money for the authorities to find .  eventually , they agree to keep the cash safe until the plane is found , and then split the money three ways .  things start going wrong , though , with greed and violence weaving their ways through their plan .  disaster is sure to strike .  director sam raimi , of the evil dead and darkman fame , has made an excellent and thought-provoking film , worlds away from the comic horror films which made his name .  while there are a couple of moments which might remind one of his earlier work , raimi has made an intelligent and mature departure which will hopefully be a sign of even greater films to come .  scott b . smith's screenplay , based on his novel ( which i haven't read ) is a fine example of escalating tension .  while it does remind one of danny boyle's shallow grave without the abundance of black humour , it keeps the drama that should really be a part of such a story on morality , or the lack thereof , found in a film with this subject matter .  alar kivilo's cinematography reminds one of joel and ethan coen's fargo , with the bleak , snowy landscape almost becoming another character .  danny elfman also does well with his moody , finely-written score .  if there's a flaw in the film , it's that it goes on for just a little too long .  just when we think that they are about to wrap things up , raimi and smith decide to let the film go on a little further .  while this isn't really a bad thing , it did become a little frustrating at times ( this may have been due to the fact that i had consumed a large sprite beforehand ) .  the performances are excellent , with the usually annoying paxton in fine form and bridget fonda giving a scene-stealing turn as hank's scheming wife .  this is an excellent showcase for thornton's fine skills as an actor and a great change in direction for raimi , who could very well have a career ahead of him as an accomplished director of dramatic films .  fingers crossed , though , that this doesn't stop him from making another evil dead sequel .
